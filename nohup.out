final answer => Based on the "Gaming Authorisations" regulations [S.L.583.05] provided, it seems that a sweepstakes gaming company would likely require a Type 2 gaming service licence. The regulations define Type 2 gaming services as:

"Type 2 gaming services: Games of chance played against the house, the outcome of which is determined by a random generator, and which are intended to produce a return to their operator over a given period of operation."

Sweepstakes games typically involve an element of chance with the outcome determined randomly, and the operator derives revenue from the games, so they would fall under this Type 2 category.

Specifically, the regulations state under Part I, Article 4:

"The Authority shall have the power to issue licences of the categories set forth in the First Schedule:
...
Provided that where Government policy requires that certain gaming services may only be provided when in possession of a Government concession, the Authority shall not issue a licence for the carrying out of such gaming service unless the applicant is in possession of such a concession."

So in summary, a sweepstakes gaming company would need to obtain a Type 2 gaming service licence from the Malta Gaming Authority, unless there is a specific Government concession required for that type of gaming, in which case they would need to obtain that concession first before being eligible for the licence.

final answer => Based on the documents provided, a sweepstakes gaming company would require a Class 4 license in order to operate in Malta. 

According to the Gaming Authorisations Regulations [S.L.583.05], Part II, Regulation 4, the Authority can issue licenses of various categories as set forth in the First Schedule. This includes:

"Class 4: To provide Type 4 gaming services, that is to say:
(a) controlled skill games; 
(b) controlled prize competitions;
(c) commercial communications games;
(d) limited commercial communications games."

Sweepstakes would fall under "commercial communications games" which are defined in the Gaming Definitions Regulations [S.L. 583.04] as:

"’commercial communication game’ means a game falling within paragraph (b) of the definition of “exempt game” in article 2 of the Act which requires a stake and offers a prize, and which is operated in conjunction with an overt commercial act, transaction, trade or sale."

Therefore, based on the definitions and license categories provided in the documents, a sweepstakes gaming company would need to apply for and obtain a Class 4 gaming license in order to legally operate in Malta. The fees and application process for this license are outlined in S.L.583.03 Gaming Licence Fees and S.L.583.05 Gaming Authorisations Regulations.

Hello
final answer => Based on the "Gaming Authorisations" regulations [S.L.583.05] provided, a sweepstakes gaming company would likely require a Type 2 gaming service licence. The regulations state:

Part I, First Schedule:
"The Authority shall have the power to issue licences of the categories set forth in the First Schedule:
...
Part B - Type 2 gaming services
Games of chance played against the house, the outcome of which is determined by a random generator, and which are intended to produce a return to their operator."

A sweepstakes game is typically considered a game of chance where the outcome is randomly determined, with the operator deriving revenue from entry fees/purchases. Therefore, it would fall under the Type 2 gaming service licence category.

The licensing requirements, eligibility criteria and procedures are further outlined in Part III of the regulations, such as in regulation 9 which states:

"A person who desires to obtain or renew a licence shall apply to the Authority by making use of the relevant prescribed forms published by the Authority and shall provide all information, documentation and assurances required and shall otherwise fulfil all the licence prerequisites prescribed by the relevant regulatory instruments in force or otherwise required by the Authority."

So in summary, based solely on the regulations provided, a sweepstakes gaming operator in Malta would need to apply for and obtain a Type 2 gaming service licence from the Malta Gaming Authority.

final answer => According to the Gaming Authorisations Regulations (SL583-05), a Class 4 remote gaming license refers to:

- During the transitory period, a license to provide gaming supplies falling under paragraph 3(a) of the First Schedule to the Gaming Authorisations Regulations. This includes gaming software and platforms. 

- After the transitory period, a license to provide a gaming supply defined as a "critical gaming supply" in the First Schedule to the Gaming Authorisations Regulations. This includes gaming software, platforms, etc. that are considered critical to the operation of a gaming service.

The regulations state that references to a gaming supply falling under paragraph 3(a) of the First Schedule shall be read as a reference to a Class 4 remote gaming service. And references to a licence under paragraph 1(b) of the First Schedule shall be read as a reference to a Class 4 remote gaming licence.

So in summary, a Class 4 license allows the holder to provide critical gaming software and platforms that enable the operation of remote gaming services in Malta. It is one of the license classes established under Malta's gaming regulatory framework.

final answer => Based on the documents provided, here are the relevant details regarding lotteries where users win prizes by buying tickets:

From the "Policy on Outsourcing by Authorised Persons" document:
It mentions that authorised persons offering betting on lotteries must establish when they will hedge their financial exposure to potential winnings, and that players' bets cannot be accepted unless the authorised person confirms the bets have been hedged.

From the "GAMING AUTHORISATIONS REGULATIONS - SL583-05" document:

1. Under the definition of "commercial communication game", it states that for a series of such games, the total prizes awarded cannot exceed €100,000 in a calendar month or €500,000 in a calendar year. Any single event cannot award a prize exceeding €50,000.

2. For "limited commercial communication games" where the stake per player does not exceed €2 and prize does not exceed €250, the total prizes cannot exceed €5,000 in a calendar month or €50,000 in a calendar year.

3. The Sixth Schedule lays out considerations the Authority will take into account in determining if a game is a skill game or controlled skill game, such as presence of random draws, monetary commitments, possibility of negative social impact, association with gambling, etc.

So in summary, the regulations provided cover limits on prizes that can be awarded for different types of commercial communication games like lotteries, as well as factors the Authority will evaluate in categorizing games. Authorised lottery operators must properly hedge potential winnings before accepting bets.

final answer => Based on the "Gaming Definitions Regulations - SL583.04" document provided, to offer lotteries where users win prizes by buying tickets, a "National Lottery licence" would be required. The relevant definition is:

"National Lottery licence" means a licence granted by the Authority in virtue of a concession by the Minister granted under article 11(3) of the Act, to operate the National Lottery games and such other games as authorised by the Authority, and subject to such terms and conditions therein, and "National Lottery licensee" shall be construed accordingly;

So a National Lottery licence, granted by the Malta Gaming Authority, is needed to legally operate lottery games where prizes are awarded to users who purchase tickets. This licence allows the operator to run games like the Grand Lottery, Super 5, Lotto and any other lottery games authorized by the Authority, subject to the terms and conditions specified in the licence.

final answer => Based on the Gaming Authorisations Regulations (S.L.583.05), there does not appear to be any specific mention of licenses or permits for games/lotteries where the prizes are cars or other physical items. However, the regulations do cover different types of gaming activities and the licensing requirements for them.

For example, Regulation 5 covers "Commercial Communication Games" which are defined as:

"Commercial communication games, wherein the value of the stake exceeds two euro (€2) per player, and the value of the prize exceeds two hundred and fifty euro (€250):

Provided that one person or entity organising a series of commercial communication games shall not cumulatively exceed one hundred thousand euro (€100,000) in prizes during any calendar month and not more than five hundred thousand euro (€500,000) during any calendar year:

Provided further that any single event shall not award a prize exceeding fifty thousand euro (€50,000);"

So while cars are not explicitly mentioned, if the value of a car being offered as a prize exceeds €50,000, it would likely fall under the category of Commercial Communication Games and require the appropriate license from the Malta Gaming Authority.

The regulations also cover "Limited Commercial Communication Games" (Regulation 6) with lower prize limits, as well as provisions for "Skill Games" (Regulation 7) and "Controlled Skill Games" (Regulation 8) which the Authority has discretion to classify based on certain criteria.

So in summary, while not explicitly stated for car prizes, the existing regulations would likely require a license depending on the value of the car prize and the specific structure/format of the game or lottery offering the car as a prize. The Malta Gaming Authority would make the determination based on the details of the particular scenario.

final answer => Based on the Gaming Authorisations Regulations (S.L.583.05), to offer lotteries where users win prizes by buying tickets, a Type 1 gaming services licence would be required. This is stated in the First Schedule of the regulations:

"Type 1 gaming services, which shall mean games of chance played against the house, the outcome of which is determined by a random generator, and shall include casino type games, including roulette, blackjack, baccarat, poker played against the house, lotteries, secondary lotteries and virtual sports games;"

The regulations define "lottery" as follows:

"lottery" means a game of chance for prizes in money or money's worth, in which the winners are determined by a random drawing of numbers or symbols, and includes lotto, bingo, keno, scratch cards and any other game which the Authority may determine as constituting a lottery;

So to offer lotteries where users purchase tickets to win prizes, the operator would need to obtain a Type 1 gaming services licence from the Malta Gaming Authority, as lotteries fall under this licence category according to the First Schedule.

final answer => Based on the "Gaming Compliance and Enforcement Regulations" (S.L.583.06) provided, a Class 1 license holder offering lotteries has the following key compliance obligations:

1. Obligation of continuous compliance (Reg. 3):
The licensee shall, throughout the term of the authorization, continuously fulfill and comply with all relevant requirements and be responsible for all obligations imposed by all applicable regulatory instruments.

2. Compliance with notified policies and procedures (Reg. 3(2)):
"An authorised person shall, throughout the term of an authorisation, comply with the policies and procedures which must be notified to the Authority in terms of any regulatory instrument, and any breach of such policies and procedures shall be tantamount to a breach of a regulatory instrument."

So in summary, a Class 1 lottery licensee must continuously comply with all relevant laws, regulations, and the specific policies/procedures they have notified to the Malta Gaming Authority throughout the duration of their license. Any breach of their notified policies/procedures would be considered a breach of the regulations.

The regulations do not go into more specific compliance requirements for lottery operators, but other regulations/instruments would likely outline additional compliance obligations related to responsible gaming, player protection, anti-money laundering, advertising, etc. that a lottery licensee must adhere to.

final answer => According to the "Gaming Compliance and Enforcement Regulations - SL583.06" document provided, Regulation 3(2) states:

"An authorised person shall, throughout the term of an authorisation, comply with the policies and procedures which must be notified to the Authority in terms of any regulatory instrument, and any breach of such policies and procedures shall be tantamount to a breach of a regulatory instrument."

This regulation imposes an obligation on authorized persons (licensees) to continuously comply with all policies and procedures that they are required to notify to the Malta Gaming Authority (the Authority) under any applicable regulatory instruments. Any breach of these notified policies and procedures is considered equivalent to a breach of the regulatory instruments themselves.

In essence, Regulation 3(2) requires licensees to adhere to their own notified policies and procedures throughout the duration of their authorization, and treats any non-compliance with those policies and procedures as a violation of the regulations.

final answer => Based on the documents provided, I did not find any specific policies or regulations mentioned for "Class 1" licenses. The documents cover various aspects of gaming licenses issued by the Malta Gaming Authority, but do not categorize them into different classes. 

However, the "Gaming Authorisations Regulations" (DOCUMENT NAME: GAMING AUTHORISATIONS REGULATIONS - SL583-05) outlines the general prerequisites and criteria for obtaining a gaming license in Malta. Some key points from this document are:

1. Section 9 states that an applicant for a license must apply using the prescribed forms, provide all required information/documentation, and fulfill all license prerequisites prescribed by the relevant regulations or required by the Authority.

2. Section 11 lists the grounds on which the Authority may refuse to grant a license, such as if the application is not properly submitted, fees are not paid, or the Authority is not satisfied about the applicant's suitability, integrity, resources etc.

3. Section 12 states that the Authority shall only grant a license if it is satisfied that the applicant meets the requirements under the regulations and is generally fit and proper to conduct the authorized gaming operations.

4. Section 13 allows the Authority to impose conditions on any license granted as it deems appropriate.

So in summary, while there are no specific "Class 1" license policies mentioned, the regulations outline the general criteria, application process, and the Authority's powers related to granting gaming licenses in Malta. Let me know if you need any other details from the provided documents.

"Type 1 gaming services, which shall mean games of chance played against the house, the outcome of which is determined by a random generator, and shall include casino type games, including roulette, blackjack, baccarat, poker played against the house, and slot games."

This definition covers traditional casino-style games where the player plays against the house/operator and the outcome is determined by a random number generator, such as roulette, blackjack, baccarat, house-banked poker games, and slot machine games.

The regulations further specify levies/taxes applicable to Type 1 gaming services:

From the "Gaming Tax Regulations" (S.L.583.10):

"(2) The levy on gaming devices payable in each and every tax period by reference to gaming devices deployed within gaming premises in the provision or conduct of Type 1 and, or Type 2 gaming services shall be thirty per cent (30%) of the aggregate gaming revenue generated during the tax period from all gaming devices deployed by that person in the provision or conduct of Type 1 and, or Type 2 gaming services."

So the levy on gaming devices for providing Type 1 (and Type 2) gaming services is 30% of the aggregate gaming revenue generated from those gaming devices during the tax period.

Query =>  What cannot be signed with a digital signature
Answer =>  According to the eIDAS Regulation (EU) 910/2014 on electronic identification and trust services, there are no explicit restrictions on what cannot be signed with a qualified electronic signature. The regulation aims to ensure that qualified electronic signatures have the equivalent legal effect as handwritten signatures.

However, it's important to note that the legal admissibility and effects of electronic signatures may be subject to additional national laws or specific legal requirements for certain types of documents or transactions. The eIDAS Regulation sets the general framework, but Member States can have additional rules regarding the use of electronic signatures in specific contexts.

Article 25 of the eIDAS Regulation states:

"1. An electronic signature shall not be denied legal effect and admissibility as evidence in legal proceedings solely on the grounds that it is in an electronic form or that it does not meet the requirements for qualified electronic signatures.

2. A qualified electronic signature shall have the equivalent legal effect of a handwritten signature."

So in principle, a qualified electronic signature can be used to sign various types of documents or data, as long as it meets the technical requirements outlined in the regulation and complies with any additional national laws or sector-specific regulations that may apply.

Query =>  what is the process to change a private company into a plc?
Answer =>  To change the status of a private company to a public limited company (plc) under Maltese Company Law, the following process must be followed:

1. The private company must alter its Memorandum and Articles of Association to incorporate all the changes required for a company to hold the status of a public company. This includes:

"A private company may change its status to a public company by altering its memorandum or articles and incorporating in such alteration all those changes required by the provisions of this Act for a company to hold the status of a public company, including the removal of the restrictions resulting by virtue of the provisions of article 209 which conflict with the status of a public company." (Article 213(1))

2. The name of the company must be changed to end with the words "public limited company" or the abbreviation "p.l.c.".

"Subject to the provisions of sub-articles (3) to (6), a public company may be designated by any name, but such name must end with the words "public limited company" or their abbreviation "p.l.c.":" (Article 70(1))

3. The company must deliver the following documents to the Registrar for registration:

a) The altered Memorandum and Articles of Association
b) A copy of a balance sheet prepared not more than 4 months before the registration date
c) A declaration by directors that between the balance sheet date and registration date, there has been no change in the company's financial position resulting in net assets becoming less than the called up share capital and undistributable reserves.

"Where a private company changes its status to a public company in accordance with the provisions of this article, the company shall, in addition to the documents referred to in sub-article (2), deliver to the Registrar for registration - 
(a) a copy of a balance sheet prepared as at a date being not more than four months before the date of the registration of the alteration referred to in sub-article (2);
(b) a declaration made by the directors of the company that between the balance sheet date and the date of delivery of the alteration to the Registrar for registration, there has been no change in the company's financial position that has resulted in the amount of its net assets becoming less than the aggregate of its called up issued share capital and undistributable reserves." (Article 213(11))

4. The Registrar will register the alteration and issue a new certificate of registration reflecting the change to a public limited company.

"The Registrar shall, upon delivery of the documents referred to in sub-article (2) and (11), register the alteration and he shall issue a certificate of registration altered to reflect that change." (Article 213(3))

Query =>  From an EU law standpoint, what considerations should be taken when a cross border merger takes place
Answer =>  When a cross-border merger takes place between companies from different EU Member States, there are several important considerations from an EU law standpoint, as outlined in Directive (EU) 2017/1132 relating to certain aspects of Company Law:

1. Types of companies eligible for cross-border merger:
Article 120 states that "Save as otherwise provided in this Chapter, (a) cross-border mergers shall only be possible between types of companies which may merge under the national law of the relevant Member States."

This means that the national laws of the Member States involved must permit mergers between the specific types of companies seeking to undertake the cross-border merger.

2. Compliance with national laws:
Article 120 further states that "(b) a company taking part in a cross-border merger shall comply with the provisions and formalities of the national law to which it is subject."

So each company involved must follow the merger procedures and formalities prescribed by its own national company law.

3. Common draft terms of cross-border merger:
Article 122 specifies the minimum particulars that must be included in the common draft terms of a cross-border merger, such as:
- The proposed form, name and registered office of the companies involved and the resulting company
- The share exchange ratio and any cash payments
- The terms for allocation of shares in the resulting company
- The likely impact on employment
- Key dates related to share entitlements, accounting treatment, etc.

4. Protection of interests of members and others:
Recital 61 states that "In order to protect the interests of members and others, the legal effects of the cross-border merger, distinguishing as to whether the company resulting from the cross-border merger is an acquiring company or a new company, should be specified."

Article 131 then details the specific consequences/effects of a cross-border merger for the companies involved, their assets/liabilities, and their members.

5. Monitoring and approval process:
Recital 60 notes that "monitoring of the completion and legality of the decision-making process in each merging company should be carried out by the national authority having jurisdiction over each of those companies, whereas monitoring of the completion and legality of the cross-border merger should be carried out by the national authority having jurisdiction over the company resulting from the cross-border merger."

So there is oversight by relevant national authorities at various stages.

Sources:
- DIRECTIVE (EU) 2017/1132, Recitals 56-64, Articles 120, 122, 131

The key considerations revolve around eligibility of the company types, compliance with respective national laws, specifying common draft merger terms, protecting interests of stakeholders, and oversight by relevant national authorities. The Directive aims to facilitate cross-border mergers while ensuring they occur in an orderly manner adhering to necessary regulations.

Query =>  explain more about the monitoring and approval process in detail
Answer =>  The monitoring and approval process for cross-border mergers under EU law involves oversight by the relevant national authorities at various stages, as per Directive (EU) 2017/1132. Here are some more details:

1. Monitoring by national authorities of each merging company:
Recital 60 states that "monitoring of the completion and legality of the decision-making process in each merging company should be carried out by the national authority having jurisdiction over each of those companies..."

This means the national authority in each Member State where the merging companies are incorporated/registered will monitor and ensure the merger decision-making process in those companies complies with relevant national laws.

2. Scrutiny of the common draft terms of merger:
Article 123 requires each merging company to make the common draft terms of the cross-border merger publicly available and submit them for scrutiny to the national authority mentioned in paragraph 1 above.

3. Independent expert reports:
Article 125 mandates that for each merging company, one or more independent experts must examine and report on the common draft terms to the company's members. The national authority can appoint these independent experts.

4. Approval by the general meeting:
Article 126 states that after taking note of the reports mentioned above, the general meeting of members of each of the merging companies has to approve the common draft terms of the cross-border merger.

5. Scrutiny of the cross-border merger by national authority:
Article 127 requires that the completion of the cross-border merger shall be scrutinized by the national authority of the Member State of the company resulting from the merger, to ensure it complies with all procedures and formalities.

6. Issue of pre-merger certificate: 
If that national authority is satisfied that all requirements have been met, it shall issue a pre-merger certificate conclusively attesting to the proper completion of the pre-merger acts and formalities (Article 127).

So in summary, there is multi-layered monitoring and approval involving national authorities of each merging company as well as the company resulting from the merger - scrutinizing draft terms, expert reports, member approvals and overall compliance with procedures.

Answer =>  Based on the provided memorandum and articles of association, here are my observations regarding compliance with the Companies Act 1995 of Malta:

1. The memorandum appears to be generally compliant, covering the required elements like company name, status as a private company, registered office, objects, capital structure, and limited liability.

2. The articles cover essential aspects like share transfers, proceedings at general meetings, appointment and powers of directors, share issues, etc. However, there are a few potential areas of concern:

a) Article 4(i) allows share transfers to affiliates without restrictions, which may conflict with the pre-emption rights process outlined earlier in the same article. This could potentially violate Section 109 of the Companies Act regarding equal treatment of shareholders.

b) Article 5(a) requires an extraordinary resolution for pledging ordinary A shares, which is more restrictive than Article 122 of the Companies Act that allows share pledging without such a resolution.

c) Article 6(d) lists certain "Shareholders Reserved Matters" requiring an extraordinary resolution, which is generally allowed under the Companies Act. However, some of the listed matters like establishing director remuneration (Article 6(d)(c)) may conflict with Article 137 of the Act, which requires an ordinary resolution for this purpose.

d) Article 7.1 excludes the application of Sections 57-61 of the First Schedule regarding retirement of directors, which may not be permissible under the Companies Act.

e) Article 7.7 imposes additional restrictions on directors with interests in contracts, beyond the requirements of Article 145 of the Companies Act.

3. There are also a few missing elements that should be considered:

a) No provisions for the appointment and removal of auditors, as required by Article 153 of the Companies Act.

b) No provisions for the keeping of accounting records and laying of accounts, as required by Articles 171-177 of the Act.

c) No provisions for the winding up of the company, as outlined in Articles 214-365 of the Act.

In summary, while the memorandum and articles cover most essential aspects, there are a few potential areas of non-compliance or conflict with the Companies Act 1995. It would be advisable to review and amend the articles to ensure full compliance with the Act.

Query =>  explain in detail - d) Article 7.1 excludes the application of Sections 57-61 of the First Schedule regarding retirement of directors, which may not be permissible under the Companies Act.
Answer =>  Article 7.1 of the provided Articles of Association states:

"Sections 57 - 61 of Part I of the First Schedule of the Companies Act 1995 shall not apply to the company and the directors of the company shall serve without retirement until death or until they shall retire or be removed in accordance with Section 140 of the Companies Act, 1995."

This provision excludes the application of Sections 57-61 of the First Schedule to the Companies Act, which deal with the retirement of directors by rotation.

Specifically, Section 57 requires that at the first annual general meeting, all directors shall retire from office. At subsequent annual general meetings, one-third of the directors (or if their number is not three or a multiple of three, the number nearest to one-third) must retire from office.

By excluding these sections, Article 7.1 effectively allows directors to serve indefinitely without being subject to retirement by rotation at annual general meetings, unless they resign or are removed in accordance with Section 140 of the Act.

This provision may not be permissible under the Companies Act for the following reasons:

1. The Companies Act does not explicitly allow companies to opt-out of the retirement by rotation requirements for directors. These provisions in the First Schedule are meant to apply to all companies unless specifically exempted by the Act itself.

2. The retirement by rotation requirements are considered an important corporate governance mechanism, ensuring periodic accountability of directors to shareholders.

3. Section 109 of the Companies Act requires equal treatment of shareholders of the same class in all respects. By allowing directors to serve indefinitely without re-election, this provision could be seen as violating the rights of shareholders to periodically vote on the composition of the board.

Therefore, while the Companies Act allows some flexibility in the articles regarding the management of the company, excluding the application of the retirement by rotation provisions altogether may be considered ultra vires (beyond the powers) and potentially unenforceable.

It would be advisable to either remove this provision or modify it to comply with the spirit of the Companies Act, ensuring a reasonable mechanism for periodic re-election or retirement of directors.

Answer =>  Based on the provided memorandum and articles of association, here are my observations regarding compliance with the Companies Act 1995 of Malta:

1. The memorandum appears to be generally compliant, covering the required elements like company name, status as a private company, registered office, objects, capital structure, and limited liability.

2. The articles cover essential aspects like share transfers, proceedings at general meetings, appointment and powers of directors, share issues, etc. However, there are a few potential areas of concern:

a) Article 4(i) allows share transfers to affiliates without restrictions, which may conflict with the pre-emption rights process outlined earlier in the same article. This could potentially violate Section 109 of the Companies Act regarding equal treatment of shareholders.

b) Article 5(a) requires an extraordinary resolution for pledging ordinary A shares, which is more restrictive than Article 122 of the Companies Act that allows share pledging without such a resolution.

c) Article 6(d) lists certain "Shareholders Reserved Matters" requiring an extraordinary resolution, which is generally allowed under the Companies Act. However, some of the listed matters like establishing director remuneration (Article 6(d)(c)) may conflict with Article 137 of the Act, which requires an ordinary resolution for this purpose.

d) Article 7.1 excludes the application of Sections 57-61 of the First Schedule regarding retirement of directors, which may not be permissible under the Companies Act.

e) Article 7.7 imposes additional restrictions on directors with interests in contracts, beyond the requirements of Article 145 of the Companies Act.

3. There are also a few missing elements that should be considered:

a) No provisions for the appointment and removal of auditors, as required by Article 153 of the Companies Act.

b) No provisions for the keeping of accounting records and laying of accounts, as required by Articles 171-177 of the Act.

c) No provisions for the winding up of the company, as outlined in Articles 214-365 of the Act.

In summary, while the memorandum and articles cover most essential aspects, there are a few potential areas of non-compliance or conflict with the Companies Act 1995. It would be advisable to review and amend the articles to ensure full compliance with the Act.

Query =>  what does section 57 specifically say
Answer =>  Section 57 of the First Schedule to the Companies Act 1995 deals with the retirement of directors by rotation. The relevant text is:

"57. (1) At the first annual general meeting of the company all the directors shall retire from office, and at the annual general meeting in every subsequent year one-third of the directors for the time being, or, if their number is not three or a multiple of three, then the number nearest one-third, shall retire from office.

(2) The directors to retire in every year shall be those who have been longest in office since their last election, but as between persons who became directors on the same day those to retire shall (unless they otherwise agree among themselves) be determined by lot.

(3) A retiring director shall be eligible for re-election.

(4) The company at the meeting at which a director retires in manner aforesaid may fill the vacated office by electing a person thereto, and in default the retiring director shall, if offering himself for re-election, be deemed to have been re-elected, unless at such meeting it is expressly resolved not to fill such vacated office or unless a resolution for the re-election of such director shall have been put to the meeting and lost."

In essence, it requires that at the first AGM all directors retire, and at subsequent AGMs, one-third of the directors must retire by rotation based on longest time in office. The retiring directors are eligible for re-election unless the shareholders expressly resolve otherwise.

By excluding the application of Sections 57-61 as stated in Article 7.1 of the company's Articles, it allows the directors to remain in office indefinitely without being subject to this periodic retirement and re-election process, which may conflict with the spirit and intent of the Companies Act provisions on corporate governance.
Query =>  explain in detail - d) Article 7.1 excludes the application of Sections 57-61 of the First Schedule regarding retirement of directors, which may not be permissible under the Companies Act.
Answer =>  Article 7.1 of the provided Articles of Association states:

"Sections 57 - 61 of Part I of the First Schedule of the Companies Act 1995 shall not apply to the company and the directors of the company shall serve without retirement until death or until they shall retire or be removed in accordance with Section 140 of the Companies Act, 1995."

This provision excludes the application of Sections 57-61 of the First Schedule to the Companies Act, which deal with the retirement of directors by rotation.

Specifically, Section 57 requires that at the first annual general meeting, all directors shall retire from office. At subsequent annual general meetings, one-third of the directors (or if their number is not three or a multiple of three, the number nearest to one-third) must retire from office.

By excluding these sections, Article 7.1 effectively allows directors to serve indefinitely without being subject to retirement by rotation at annual general meetings, unless they resign or are removed in accordance with Section 140 of the Act.

This provision may not be permissible under the Companies Act for the following reasons:

1. The Companies Act does not explicitly allow companies to opt-out of the retirement by rotation requirements for directors. These provisions in the First Schedule are meant to apply to all companies unless specifically exempted by the Act itself.

2. The retirement by rotation requirements are considered an important corporate governance mechanism, ensuring periodic accountability of directors to shareholders.

3. Section 109 of the Companies Act requires equal treatment of shareholders of the same class in all respects. By allowing directors to serve indefinitely without re-election, this provision could be seen as violating the rights of shareholders to periodically vote on the composition of the board.

Therefore, while the Companies Act allows some flexibility in the articles regarding the management of the company, excluding the application of the retirement by rotation provisions altogether may be considered ultra vires (beyond the powers) and potentially unenforceable.

It would be advisable to either remove this provision or modify it to comply with the spirit of the Companies Act, ensuring a reasonable mechanism for periodic re-election or retirement of directors.

Answer =>  Based on the provided memorandum and articles of association, here are my observations regarding compliance with the Companies Act 1995 of Malta:

1. The memorandum appears to be generally compliant, covering the required elements like company name, status as a private company, registered office, objects, capital structure, and limited liability.

2. The articles cover essential aspects like share transfers, proceedings at general meetings, appointment and powers of directors, share issues, etc. However, there are a few potential areas of concern:

a) Article 4(i) allows share transfers to affiliates without restrictions, which may conflict with the pre-emption rights process outlined earlier in the same article. This could potentially violate Section 109 of the Companies Act regarding equal treatment of shareholders.

b) Article 5(a) requires an extraordinary resolution for pledging ordinary A shares, which is more restrictive than Article 122 of the Companies Act that allows share pledging without such a resolution.

c) Article 6(d) lists certain "Shareholders Reserved Matters" requiring an extraordinary resolution, which is generally allowed under the Companies Act. However, some of the listed matters like establishing director remuneration (Article 6(d)(c)) may conflict with Article 137 of the Act, which requires an ordinary resolution for this purpose.

d) Article 7.1 excludes the application of Sections 57-61 of the First Schedule regarding retirement of directors, which may not be permissible under the Companies Act.

e) Article 7.7 imposes additional restrictions on directors with interests in contracts, beyond the requirements of Article 145 of the Companies Act.

3. There are also a few missing elements that should be considered:

a) No provisions for the appointment and removal of auditors, as required by Article 153 of the Companies Act.

b) No provisions for the keeping of accounting records and laying of accounts, as required by Articles 171-177 of the Act.

c) No provisions for the winding up of the company, as outlined in Articles 214-365 of the Act.

In summary, while the memorandum and articles cover most essential aspects, there are a few potential areas of non-compliance or conflict with the Companies Act 1995. It would be advisable to review and amend the articles to ensure full compliance with the Act.

Answer =>  Here is a draft email to the service provider who created the Memorandum and Articles of Association, explaining the findings regarding compliance with the Companies Act 1995 of Malta:

Subject: Review of Memorandum & Articles of Association for Binderr Ltd  

Dear [Service Provider],

I am writing regarding the Memorandum and Articles of Association you prepared for our company Binderr Ltd. We have reviewed the documents against the requirements of the Companies Act 1995 of Malta, and would like to bring the following observations to your attention:

1. Article 4(i) allows share transfers to affiliates without restrictions, which may conflict with the pre-emption rights process outlined earlier and violate Section 109 of the Act regarding equal treatment of shareholders.

2. Article 5(a) requires an extraordinary resolution for pledging ordinary A shares, which is more restrictive than permitted under Article 122 of the Act.  

3. Article 6(d)(c) lists establishing director remuneration as a "Shareholders Reserved Matter" requiring an extraordinary resolution, while Article 137 of the Act requires only an ordinary resolution for this.

4. Article 7.1 excludes the application of Sections 57-61 of the First Schedule regarding retirement of directors by rotation, which may not be permissible under the Act.

5. Article 7.7 imposes additional restrictions on directors with interests in contracts, beyond the requirements of Article 145 of the Act.

6. The Articles lack provisions for appointment/removal of auditors (required under Article 153), keeping of accounting records and laying of accounts (Articles 171-177), and winding up of the company (Articles 214-365).

While the documents cover most essential aspects, the above-mentioned potential areas of non-compliance or conflict with the Companies Act 1995 should be reviewed and amended as necessary to ensure full compliance.

I would appreciate if you could review these observations and provide your recommendations for aligning the Memorandum and Articles with the Act's requirements.

Thank you for your assistance. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
[Your name]
Query =>  what does section 57 specifically say
Answer =>  Section 57 of the First Schedule to the Companies Act 1995 deals with the retirement of directors by rotation. The relevant text is:

"57. (1) At the first annual general meeting of the company all the directors shall retire from office, and at the annual general meeting in every subsequent year one-third of the directors for the time being, or, if their number is not three or a multiple of three, then the number nearest one-third, shall retire from office.

(2) The directors to retire in every year shall be those who have been longest in office since their last election, but as between persons who became directors on the same day those to retire shall (unless they otherwise agree among themselves) be determined by lot.

(3) A retiring director shall be eligible for re-election.

(4) The company at the meeting at which a director retires in manner aforesaid may fill the vacated office by electing a person thereto, and in default the retiring director shall, if offering himself for re-election, be deemed to have been re-elected, unless at such meeting it is expressly resolved not to fill such vacated office or unless a resolution for the re-election of such director shall have been put to the meeting and lost."

In essence, it requires that at the first AGM all directors retire, and at subsequent AGMs, one-third of the directors must retire by rotation based on longest time in office. The retiring directors are eligible for re-election unless the shareholders expressly resolve otherwise.

By excluding the application of Sections 57-61 as stated in Article 7.1 of the company's Articles, it allows the directors to remain in office indefinitely without being subject to this periodic retirement and re-election process, which may conflict with the spirit and intent of the Companies Act provisions on corporate governance.
Query =>  explain in detail - d) Article 7.1 excludes the application of Sections 57-61 of the First Schedule regarding retirement of directors, which may not be permissible under the Companies Act.
Answer =>  Article 7.1 of the provided Articles of Association states:

"Sections 57 - 61 of Part I of the First Schedule of the Companies Act 1995 shall not apply to the company and the directors of the company shall serve without retirement until death or until they shall retire or be removed in accordance with Section 140 of the Companies Act, 1995."

This provision excludes the application of Sections 57-61 of the First Schedule to the Companies Act, which deal with the retirement of directors by rotation.

Specifically, Section 57 requires that at the first annual general meeting, all directors shall retire from office. At subsequent annual general meetings, one-third of the directors (or if their number is not three or a multiple of three, the number nearest to one-third) must retire from office.

By excluding these sections, Article 7.1 effectively allows directors to serve indefinitely without being subject to retirement by rotation at annual general meetings, unless they resign or are removed in accordance with Section 140 of the Act.

This provision may not be permissible under the Companies Act for the following reasons:

1. The Companies Act does not explicitly allow companies to opt-out of the retirement by rotation requirements for directors. These provisions in the First Schedule are meant to apply to all companies unless specifically exempted by the Act itself.

2. The retirement by rotation requirements are considered an important corporate governance mechanism, ensuring periodic accountability of directors to shareholders.

3. Section 109 of the Companies Act requires equal treatment of shareholders of the same class in all respects. By allowing directors to serve indefinitely without re-election, this provision could be seen as violating the rights of shareholders to periodically vote on the composition of the board.

Therefore, while the Companies Act allows some flexibility in the articles regarding the management of the company, excluding the application of the retirement by rotation provisions altogether may be considered ultra vires (beyond the powers) and potentially unenforceable.

It would be advisable to either remove this provision or modify it to comply with the spirit of the Companies Act, ensuring a reasonable mechanism for periodic re-election or retirement of directors.

Answer =>  Based on the provided memorandum and articles of association, here are my observations regarding compliance with the Companies Act 1995 of Malta:

1. The memorandum appears to be generally compliant, covering the required elements like company name, status as a private company, registered office, objects, capital structure, and limited liability.

2. The articles cover essential aspects like share transfers, proceedings at general meetings, appointment and powers of directors, share issues, etc. However, there are a few potential areas of concern:

a) Article 4(i) allows share transfers to affiliates without restrictions, which may conflict with the pre-emption rights process outlined earlier in the same article. This could potentially violate Section 109 of the Companies Act regarding equal treatment of shareholders.

b) Article 5(a) requires an extraordinary resolution for pledging ordinary A shares, which is more restrictive than Article 122 of the Companies Act that allows share pledging without such a resolution.

c) Article 6(d) lists certain "Shareholders Reserved Matters" requiring an extraordinary resolution, which is generally allowed under the Companies Act. However, some of the listed matters like establishing director remuneration (Article 6(d)(c)) may conflict with Article 137 of the Act, which requires an ordinary resolution for this purpose.

d) Article 7.1 excludes the application of Sections 57-61 of the First Schedule regarding retirement of directors, which may not be permissible under the Companies Act.

e) Article 7.7 imposes additional restrictions on directors with interests in contracts, beyond the requirements of Article 145 of the Companies Act.

3. There are also a few missing elements that should be considered:

a) No provisions for the appointment and removal of auditors, as required by Article 153 of the Companies Act.

b) No provisions for the keeping of accounting records and laying of accounts, as required by Articles 171-177 of the Act.

c) No provisions for the winding up of the company, as outlined in Articles 214-365 of the Act.

In summary, while the memorandum and articles cover most essential aspects, there are a few potential areas of non-compliance or conflict with the Companies Act 1995. It would be advisable to review and amend the articles to ensure full compliance with the Act.

Answer =>  Here is a draft email explaining in detail the potential areas of non-compliance with the Companies Act 1995 in the Memorandum and Articles of Association for Binderr Ltd:

Subject: Review of Memorandum & Articles of Association for Binderr Ltd  

Dear [Service Provider],

I am writing regarding the Memorandum and Articles of Association you prepared for our company Binderr Ltd. We have reviewed the documents against the requirements of the Companies Act 1995 of Malta, and would like to bring the following observations to your attention:

1. Article 4(i) allows share transfers to affiliates without restrictions, which may conflict with the pre-emption rights process outlined earlier and violate Section 109 of the Act regarding equal treatment of shareholders.

Specifically, Section 109 requires all shares to be offered to existing shareholders proportionately before being offered to non-shareholders. By exempting affiliate transfers from this pre-emption process, Article 4(i) could be seen as discriminatory treatment of certain shareholders.

2. Article 5(a) requires an extraordinary resolution for pledging ordinary A shares, which is more restrictive than permitted under Article 122 of the Act.  

Article 122 allows companies to permit share pledging without needing an extraordinary resolution, as long as this is stated in the articles. By requiring such a resolution for ordinary A shares, Article 5(a) imposes an additional restriction beyond what the Act mandates.

3. Article 6(d)(c) lists establishing director remuneration as a "Shareholders Reserved Matter" requiring an extraordinary resolution, while Article 137 of the Act requires only an ordinary resolution for this.

This conflicts with the Companies Act, which states that director remuneration can be approved by an ordinary resolution unless the articles require a higher threshold.

4. Article 7.1 excludes the application of Sections 57-61 of the First Schedule regarding retirement of directors by rotation, which may not be permissible under the Act.

The Companies Act does not explicitly allow companies to opt-out of these provisions for periodic retirement and re-election of directors. Excluding them altogether could be seen as violating principles of good corporate governance.

5. Article 7.7 imposes additional restrictions on directors with interests in contracts, beyond the requirements of Article 145 of the Act.

While Article 145 prohibits interested directors from voting, Article 7.7 goes further by excluding them from being counted towards quorum as well. This additional restriction may exceed the scope permitted by the Act.

6. The Articles lack provisions for appointment/removal of auditors (required under Article 153), keeping of accounting records and laying of accounts (Articles 171-177), and winding up of the company (Articles 214-365).

These are essential aspects that should be covered in the company's articles to ensure compliance with the relevant sections of the Companies Act.

While the documents cover most essential aspects, the above-mentioned potential areas of non-compliance or conflict with the Companies Act 1995 should be reviewed and amended as necessary to ensure full compliance.

I would appreciate if you could review these observations and provide your recommendations for aligning the Memorandum and Articles with the Act's requirements.

Thank you for your assistance. I look forward to your response.

Query =>  what does section 57 specifically say
Answer =>  Section 57 of the First Schedule to the Companies Act 1995 deals with the retirement of directors by rotation. The relevant text is:

"57. (1) At the first annual general meeting of the company all the directors shall retire from office, and at the annual general meeting in every subsequent year one-third of the directors for the time being, or, if their number is not three or a multiple of three, then the number nearest one-third, shall retire from office.

(2) The directors to retire in every year shall be those who have been longest in office since their last election, but as between persons who became directors on the same day those to retire shall (unless they otherwise agree among themselves) be determined by lot.

(3) A retiring director shall be eligible for re-election.

(4) The company at the meeting at which a director retires in manner aforesaid may fill the vacated office by electing a person thereto, and in default the retiring director shall, if offering himself for re-election, be deemed to have been re-elected, unless at such meeting it is expressly resolved not to fill such vacated office or unless a resolution for the re-election of such director shall have been put to the meeting and lost."

In essence, it requires that at the first AGM all directors retire, and at subsequent AGMs, one-third of the directors must retire by rotation based on longest time in office. The retiring directors are eligible for re-election unless the shareholders expressly resolve otherwise.

By excluding the application of Sections 57-61 as stated in Article 7.1 of the company's Articles, it allows the directors to remain in office indefinitely without being subject to this periodic retirement and re-election process, which may conflict with the spirit and intent of the Companies Act provisions on corporate governance.
Query =>  explain in detail - d) Article 7.1 excludes the application of Sections 57-61 of the First Schedule regarding retirement of directors, which may not be permissible under the Companies Act.
Answer =>  Article 7.1 of the provided Articles of Association states:

"Sections 57 - 61 of Part I of the First Schedule of the Companies Act 1995 shall not apply to the company and the directors of the company shall serve without retirement until death or until they shall retire or be removed in accordance with Section 140 of the Companies Act, 1995."

This provision excludes the application of Sections 57-61 of the First Schedule to the Companies Act, which deal with the retirement of directors by rotation.

Specifically, Section 57 requires that at the first annual general meeting, all directors shall retire from office. At subsequent annual general meetings, one-third of the directors (or if their number is not three or a multiple of three, the number nearest to one-third) must retire from office.

By excluding these sections, Article 7.1 effectively allows directors to serve indefinitely without being subject to retirement by rotation at annual general meetings, unless they resign or are removed in accordance with Section 140 of the Act.

This provision may not be permissible under the Companies Act for the following reasons:

1. The Companies Act does not explicitly allow companies to opt-out of the retirement by rotation requirements for directors. These provisions in the First Schedule are meant to apply to all companies unless specifically exempted by the Act itself.

2. The retirement by rotation requirements are considered an important corporate governance mechanism, ensuring periodic accountability of directors to shareholders.

3. Section 109 of the Companies Act requires equal treatment of shareholders of the same class in all respects. By allowing directors to serve indefinitely without re-election, this provision could be seen as violating the rights of shareholders to periodically vote on the composition of the board.

Therefore, while the Companies Act allows some flexibility in the articles regarding the management of the company, excluding the application of the retirement by rotation provisions altogether may be considered ultra vires (beyond the powers) and potentially unenforceable.

It would be advisable to either remove this provision or modify it to comply with the spirit of the Companies Act, ensuring a reasonable mechanism for periodic re-election or retirement of directors.

Query =>  explain article (Articles 214-365)
Answer =>  Articles 214-365 of the Companies Act 1995 deal with the winding up of companies in Malta. This is a significant part of the Act that covers the various procedures and rules related to the dissolution and liquidation of companies.

Some key aspects covered under Articles 214-365 include:

1. Modes of Winding Up (Articles 214-216)
This outlines the different modes by which a company may be wound up - compulsory winding up by the court, voluntary winding up by members/creditors, or subject to court supervision.

2. Provisions related to Compulsory Winding Up (Articles 217-285)
This extensive section covers the circumstances under which a company may be wound up by the court, who can make an application, powers of the court, appointment and powers of official receivers and provisional administrators, effects of winding up order, duties of liquidators, and many other procedural aspects.

3. Provisions related to Voluntary Winding Up (Articles 286-319)
This covers the procedures for a voluntary winding up, initiation by members/creditors, appointment of liquidators, duties and powers of liquidators, distribution of assets, and dissolution of the company.

4. Provisions Applicable to Every Mode of Winding Up (Articles 320-346)
This includes general rules applicable to all modes of winding up, such as provisions regarding liquidators, exercise of court's powers, deferred debts, preferential payments, disclaimer of onerous property, offences by officers of companies being wound up, and dissolution of the company.

5. Supplemental Provisions (Articles 347-365)
This contains supplementary rules related to winding up, including provisions regarding companies incorporated outside Malta, companies that have been dissolved, and rules related to contributories.

The Articles provide a comprehensive framework governing the entire winding up process, from the circumstances triggering it to the final dissolution of the company. They aim to protect the interests of creditors, shareholders, and other stakeholders while ensuring an orderly and lawful liquidation process.

Given the significance of winding up procedures, it is essential for a company's Articles of Association to incorporate or make reference to these provisions to ensure compliance with the Act.

Subject: Review of Memorandum & Articles of Association for Binderr Ltd  

Dear [Service Provider],

I am writing regarding the Memorandum and Articles of Association you prepared for our company Binderr Ltd. We have reviewed the documents against the requirements of the Companies Act 1995 of Malta, and would like to bring the following observations to your attention:

1. Article 4(i) allows share transfers to affiliates without restrictions, which may conflict with the pre-emption rights process outlined earlier and violate Section 109 of the Act regarding equal treatment of shareholders.

Specifically, Section 109 requires all shares to be offered to existing shareholders proportionately before being offered to non-shareholders. By exempting affiliate transfers from this pre-emption process, Article 4(i) could be seen as discriminatory treatment of certain shareholders.

2. Article 5(a) requires an extraordinary resolution for pledging ordinary A shares, which is more restrictive than permitted under Article 122 of the Act.  

Article 122 allows companies to permit share pledging without needing an extraordinary resolution, as long as this is stated in the articles. By requiring such a resolution for ordinary A shares, Article 5(a) imposes an additional restriction beyond what the Act mandates.

3. Article 6(d)(c) lists establishing director remuneration as a "Shareholders Reserved Matter" requiring an extraordinary resolution, while Article 137 of the Act requires only an ordinary resolution for this.

This conflicts with the Companies Act, which states that director remuneration can be approved by an ordinary resolution unless the articles require a higher threshold.

4. Article 7.1 excludes the application of Sections 57-61 of the First Schedule regarding retirement of directors by rotation, which may not be permissible under the Act.

The Companies Act does not explicitly allow companies to opt-out of these provisions for periodic retirement and re-election of directors. Excluding them altogether could be seen as violating principles of good corporate governance.

5. Article 7.7 imposes additional restrictions on directors with interests in contracts, beyond the requirements of Article 145 of the Act.

While Article 145 prohibits interested directors from voting, Article 7.7 goes further by excluding them from being counted towards quorum as well. This additional restriction may exceed the scope permitted by the Act.

6. The Articles lack provisions for appointment/removal of auditors (required under Article 153), keeping of accounting records and laying of accounts (Articles 171-177), and winding up of the company (Articles 214-365).

These are essential aspects that should be covered in the company's articles to ensure compliance with the relevant sections of the Companies Act.

While the documents cover most essential aspects, the above-mentioned potential areas of non-compliance or conflict with the Companies Act 1995 should be reviewed and amended as necessary to ensure full compliance.

I would appreciate if you could review these observations and provide your recommendations for aligning the Memorandum and Articles with the Act's requirements.

Thank you for your assistance. I look forward to your response.

Query =>  what does section 57 specifically say
Answer =>  Section 57 of the First Schedule to the Companies Act 1995 deals with the retirement of directors by rotation. The relevant text is:

"57. (1) At the first annual general meeting of the company all the directors shall retire from office, and at the annual general meeting in every subsequent year one-third of the directors for the time being, or, if their number is not three or a multiple of three, then the number nearest one-third, shall retire from office.

(2) The directors to retire in every year shall be those who have been longest in office since their last election, but as between persons who became directors on the same day those to retire shall (unless they otherwise agree among themselves) be determined by lot.

(3) A retiring director shall be eligible for re-election.

(4) The company at the meeting at which a director retires in manner aforesaid may fill the vacated office by electing a person thereto, and in default the retiring director shall, if offering himself for re-election, be deemed to have been re-elected, unless at such meeting it is expressly resolved not to fill such vacated office or unless a resolution for the re-election of such director shall have been put to the meeting and lost."

In essence, it requires that at the first AGM all directors retire, and at subsequent AGMs, one-third of the directors must retire by rotation based on longest time in office. The retiring directors are eligible for re-election unless the shareholders expressly resolve otherwise.

By excluding the application of Sections 57-61 as stated in Article 7.1 of the company's Articles, it allows the directors to remain in office indefinitely without being subject to this periodic retirement and re-election process, which may conflict with the spirit and intent of the Companies Act provisions on corporate governance.

Query =>  list article 347
Answer =>  Unfortunately, the full text of Article 347 is not provided in the context given. However, based on the information that Article 347 falls under the "Supplemental Provisions" section of the Companies Act 1995 (Articles 347-365), I can infer that it likely contains supplementary rules related to the winding up of companies.

The context mentions that the "Supplemental Provisions" section "contains supplementary rules related to winding up, including provisions regarding companies incorporated outside Malta, companies that have been dissolved, and rules related to contributories."

Without the specific text, I cannot provide the exact details of what Article 347 covers. However, it is reasonable to assume that it deals with some supplementary aspect related to the winding up process, potentially concerning companies incorporated outside Malta, dissolved companies, or rules for contributories (parties liable to contribute to the assets of a company being wound up).

I apologize that I cannot give you the precise contents of Article 347, as the relevant text from the Companies Act is not included in the provided context. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional information that could help me better understand and explain this article.
Query =>  explain article (Articles 214-365)
Answer =>  Articles 214-365 of the Companies Act 1995 deal with the winding up of companies in Malta. This is a significant part of the Act that covers the various procedures and rules related to the dissolution and liquidation of companies.

Some key aspects covered under Articles 214-365 include:

1. Modes of Winding Up (Articles 214-216)
This outlines the different modes by which a company may be wound up - compulsory winding up by the court, voluntary winding up by members/creditors, or subject to court supervision.

2. Provisions related to Compulsory Winding Up (Articles 217-285)
This extensive section covers the circumstances under which a company may be wound up by the court, who can make an application, powers of the court, appointment and powers of official receivers and provisional administrators, effects of winding up order, duties of liquidators, and many other procedural aspects.

3. Provisions related to Voluntary Winding Up (Articles 286-319)

Query =>  Where can a maltese gaming license be used
Answer =>  According to the "Gaming Premises Regulations" (Document Name: GAMING PREMISES REGULATIONS - SL583-07), gaming services in Malta are subject to certain restrictions and requirements:

1. Gaming services can only be provided on authorized premises within Malta. Regulation 2 states:

"No gaming service may be provided on vessels, aircraft or other vehicles in Malta, with the exception of authorised cruise casinos."

2. The regulations cover the approval process for gaming premises within Malta, registration of players, self-exclusion procedures, and rules for controlled gaming premises.

3. As for the geographical scope of a Maltese gaming license, the "Gaming Authorisations Regulations" (Document Name: GAMING AUTHORISATIONS REGULATIONS - SL583.05) provide some relevant information:

Regulation 10(1) states: "A person is not eligible to hold a licence unless such person is established in the European Economic Area."

This suggests that a Maltese gaming license allows the licensee to operate within the European Economic Area (EEA), which comprises the EU member states and certain other European countries.

However, the regulations do not explicitly restrict the use of the license only within Malta or the EEA. The licensing requirements, such as the location of technical infrastructure (data centers, servers, etc.), are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, including potential locations outside the EEA (Regulation 10(3)).

In summary, while a Maltese gaming license is primarily intended for operating within Malta and the EEA, the geographical scope may extend beyond these regions, subject to meeting the licensing authority's assessments and requirements for each specific case.

Query =>  Can a non maltese company apply for a license
Answer =>  Yes, a non-Maltese company can apply for a gaming license in Malta, provided it meets certain eligibility criteria outlined in the Gaming Authorisations Regulations (S.L.583.05). Specifically, regulation 10(1) states:

"A person is not eligible to hold a licence unless such person is established in the European Economic Area."

So the key requirement is that the applicant company must be established (have a legal presence/registered office) in the European Economic Area (EEA), which includes all European Union member states as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.

The regulations also allow a body corporate applicant to apply for a license either for itself or for its entire corporate group, as per regulation 10(2):

"Where the applicant for a licence is a body corporate, such applicant may apply for a licence either for itself only or for its corporate group."

To summarize, a non-Maltese company established in any EEA country is eligible to apply for a Malta gaming license, either just for itself or covering its whole corporate group.

Query =>  what tax regimes are applicable for gaming licenses
Answer =>  The tax regimes applicable for gaming licenses in Malta are outlined in the Gaming Tax Regulations (S.L.583.10). There are two main tax components:

1. Gaming Tax

As per Part II, Regulation 3 of the Gaming Tax Regulations, any person offering gaming services to players physically present in Malta (or established/residing in Malta for remote gaming) must pay a gaming tax of 5% of the gaming revenue generated during each tax period.

The definition of "gaming revenue" is provided in the regulations:

"gaming revenue" means the aggregate stakes and wagers, inclusive of any bonus or other player incentives which are comprised within any stake or wager, less an amount to be determined by summing up the aggregate player winnings to the aggregate of any bonus or other player incentives which are comprised within the amount of aggregate stakes and wagers..."

(Source: Gaming Tax Regulations, S.L.583.10, Part II, Regulation 3)

2. Levy on Gaming Devices 

Part III, Regulations 4 and 5 outline a levy payable on gaming devices used to provide gaming services. The levy rate varies based on the type of gaming service and location:

- 30% of gaming revenue for Type 1 (casino-type games) and Type 2 (lotteries) gaming in gaming premises

- 12.5% of gaming revenue for Type 3 (games of chance) and Type 4 (skill games) in gaming premises  

- 15% of gaming revenue for Type 1, 2, 3, 4 in controlled gaming premises

- 2.5% of gaming revenue for Type 3 classified as a "junket event"

(Source: Gaming Tax Regulations, S.L.583.10, Part III, Regulations 4 and 5)

So in summary, gaming licensees in Malta are subject to a 5% gaming tax on revenue as well as a levy ranging from 2.5% to 30% on gaming device revenue, depending on the service type and location.

Answer =>  According to the Companies Act of Malta, auditors have certain obligations and rights in relation to the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of a company. Here are the key provisions:

1. The auditors' report must be read before the company at the AGM (Article 179(2)):
"The auditors' report shall be read before the company in general meeting, and be open to the inspection of any member of the company."

2. Auditors have the right to attend and be heard at any general meeting, including the AGM (Article 155):
"A company's auditors shall be entitled -
(a) to receive all notices of, and other communications relating to, any general meeting which a member of the company is entitled to receive;
(b) to attend any general meeting of the company; and 
(c) to be heard at any general meeting which they attend on any part of the business of the meeting which concerns them as auditors."

3. If the auditors have resigned, they still have the right to attend the AGM and be heard on matters concerning them as former auditors (Article 87(7)):
"An auditor who has resigned has, notwithstanding his resignation, the rights conferred by regulation 87 in relation to any such general meeting of the company as is mentioned in subregulation (3)(a) or (b), and, in such a case, the references in that regulation to matters concerning the auditor as auditor shall be construed accordingly."

4. If the directors fail to circulate the auditors' statement to members before the AGM, the auditor can require that the statement be read out at the meeting (Article 87(6)):
"If a copy of the statement is not sent out as required because it was received too late or because of the company's default, the auditor may, without prejudice to his right to be heard orally, require that the statement be read out at the meeting."

Query =>  what are the annual fees applicable to an ltd
Answer =>  The Companies Act (Fees) Regulations (S.L. 386.03) specify the annual fees applicable to a limited liability company (Ltd) in Malta. Here are the relevant provisions:

Registration of an annual return of a company other than an investment company with variable share capital (Regulation 5(i)):

So in summary, the annual return filing fee for an Ltd company ranges from €85 to €1,400, depending on the authorized share capital amount.

Query =>  assuming there are 4 shareholders in a company, 2 own 90% between them and 1 owns 6% and another one 4%. Who has a right to elect a director and what is the minimum number of directors
Answer =>  According to the Companies Act of Malta, the right to appoint directors depends on the provisions in the company's memorandum and articles of association. However, the Act provides some general rules:

1. Appointment of directors (Article 137(3)):
"Unless otherwise provided in the memorandum or articles of a company, a director of a company other than the first directors shall be appointed by ordinary resolution of the company in general meeting."

2. Right of class shareholders to appoint directors (Article 137(4)): 
"Where the holders of a particular class of shares have the right to appoint one or more directors, in terms of the memorandum and articles of the company, such appointment shall be made by a member or members holding in the aggregate more than fifty per cent in nominal value of the shares represented and entitled to vote at the meeting of the holders of the shares of that class."

In the scenario provided:
- The two shareholders owning 90% between them would likely have the right to appoint directors by ordinary resolution, unless the articles state otherwise.
- The shareholder with 6% may or may not have a right to appoint a director, depending on the articles.
- The shareholder with 4% is unlikely to have the right to appoint a director individually.

As for the minimum number of directors, Article 137(1) states:
"Every company shall have at least two directors."

So the minimum number of directors required for this company would be two.

However, the specific rights and procedures would depend on what is stated in the company's memorandum and articles of association.

Query =>  Let us assume that there is a fundraise and the shareholder with 4% cannot partake and will lead to dilution. What protection does the law offer
Answer =>  The Companies Act of Malta provides certain protections for minority shareholders in the event of a new issue of shares that may lead to dilution of their shareholding.

The key provision is Article 88 which deals with the pre-emptive rights of existing shareholders:

Article 88(1) states:
"Whenever shares of a public company are proposed to be allotted for consideration in cash, those shares shall be offered on a pre-emptive basis to shareholders in proportion to the share capital held by them."

This means that when a company issues new shares for cash, it must first offer those shares to the existing shareholders in proportion to their current shareholdings. This gives all shareholders, including minority holders, the right to subscribe for new shares to maintain their percentage ownership.

However, Article 88(2)(a) allows an exception for shares "which carry a limited right to participate in distributions...or in the company's assets in the event of liquidation."

So if the minority shareholder with 4% holds a class of shares with limited rights, the company may be able to issue new shares without offering them to that shareholder on a pre-emptive basis.

Additionally, Article 88(4) states:
"The right of pre-emption may not be restricted or withdrawn by the statutes or instrument of incorporation. This may, however, be done by decision of the general meeting."

This means the pre-emptive rights can be restricted or withdrawn by a decision of the general meeting, which the majority shareholders can approve.

So in summary, while the law provides pre-emptive rights to protect minority shareholders from dilution, there are exceptions based on the class of shares held and the ability for the majority to override these rights by a general meeting decision.

Query =>  In summary what protection to small shareholders does the law offer
Answer =>  The Companies Act of Malta provides several protections for minority or small shareholders. Here's a summary:

1. Pre-emptive rights (Article 88):
When a company issues new shares for cash, it must first offer those shares to existing shareholders in proportion to their current shareholdings. This allows minority shareholders to maintain their percentage ownership and avoid dilution.

2. Right to appoint directors (Article 137(4)):
If the company's memorandum and articles provide for it, holders of a particular class of shares have the right to appoint one or more directors if they hold more than 50% of the shares in that class.

3. Right to call a general meeting (Article 120(1)(b)): 
Shareholders holding at least 10% of the paid-up share capital can request the directors to convene a general meeting.

4. Right to circulate statements (Article 135(1)(a)):
Shareholders holding at least 10% of the paid-up capital can request the company to circulate statements relating to resolutions or other matters to be discussed at an upcoming general meeting.

5. Right to apply to court (Article 148(1)):
Shareholders holding at least 15% of the issued share capital can apply to court to appoint one or more competent inspectors to investigate the company's affairs.

6. Right to object to mergers/divisions (Article 335(3), 352(3)):
Minority shareholders who voted against a merger or division have the right to exercise exit rights and receive compensation for their shares.

While these provisions aim to protect minority shareholders, it's important to note that the specific rights may depend on the company's memorandum and articles of association.

However, Article 88(2)(a) allows an exception for shares "which carry a limited right to participate in distributions...or in the company's assets in the event of liquidation."

Additionally, Article 88(4) states:
"The right of pre-emption may not be restricted or withdrawn by the statutes or instrument of incorporation. This may, however, be done by decision of the general meeting."

This means the pre-emptive rights can be restricted or withdrawn by a decision of the general meeting, which the majority shareholders can approve.

"Every company shall have at least two directors."

So the minimum number of directors required for this company would be two.

However, the specific rights and procedures would depend on what is stated in the company's memorandum and articles of association.

Query =>  what are the annual fees applicable to an ltd
Answer =>  The Companies Act (Fees) Regulations (S.L. 386.03) specify the annual fees applicable to a limited liability company (Ltd) in Malta. Here are the relevant provisions:

Registration of an annual return of a company other than an investment company with variable share capital (Regulation 5(i)):

If the authorized share capital of the company:

i) does not exceed €1,500 - €100 (paper format) or €85 (electronic format)

ii) exceeds €1,500 but does not exceed €5,000 - €140 (paper) or €120 (electronic)  

iii) exceeds €5,000 but does not exceed €10,000 - €160 (paper) or €135 (electronic)

iv) exceeds €10,000 but does not exceed €50,000 - €350 (paper) or €300 (electronic)

v) exceeds €50,000 but does not exceed €100,000 - €400 (paper) or €340 (electronic)

vi) exceeds €100,000 but does not exceed €250,000 - €600 (paper) or €510 (electronic)  

vii) exceeds €250,000 but does not exceed €500,000 - €800 (paper) or €680 (electronic)

viii) exceeds €500,000 but does not exceed €1,000,000 - €900 (paper) or €765 (electronic)

ix) exceeds €1,000,000 but does not exceed €2,500,000 - €1,200 (paper) or €1,020 (electronic)

x) exceeds €2,500,000 - €1,400 (paper) or €1,200 (electronic)

So in summary, the annual return filing fee for an Ltd company ranges from €85 to €1,400, depending on the authorized share capital amount.

Query =>  What are the corporate tax rates
Answer =>  The documents provided do not appear to contain specific information about corporate tax rates in Malta. The context discusses whistleblower protection related to breaches of corporate tax law and tax evasion schemes, as well as fees for various company filings and penalties under the Companies Act. However, there are no details given on the actual corporate tax rates applicable in Malta.

Since the vector database does not seem to cover corporate tax rates, I cannot provide a substantive answer to that query based solely on the information present in these documents. To get accurate and up-to-date details on Malta's corporate tax rates, one would need to consult other authoritative sources like the Malta tax authorities' website or publications.

Sources:
- Document discussing whistleblower protection directive (sections quoted but no relevant information on tax rates)
- Companies Act fees schedule (no information on tax rates)

Query =>  can a contract between two parties be infinite
Answer =>  No, under Maltese law, a contract cannot be infinite or have an indefinite duration. The Civil Code has provisions that require the subject matter of a contract to be determinate and certain. Specifically:

Article 983(1) states: "The subject of an obligation must be a thing determinate, at least as to its species."

Article 984(1) allows future things to be the subject of a contract, but Article 984(2) prohibits renouncing a succession that has not yet devolved or making any stipulation regarding such a future succession.

These provisions indicate that while contracts can relate to future obligations, the subject matter must still be determinate and cannot be indefinite or infinite in nature.

The law aims to provide certainty in contractual obligations. An infinite or perpetual contract would violate this principle of determinacy required for valid contracts under Maltese law.

Query =>  a minority shareholder of a company is claiming that the company raised money with the deliberate aim to dilute his shareholding as the company could have obtained bank finance instead. what does the law say about this
Answer =>  The Maltese Companies Act and related regulations provide certain protections for minority shareholders against dilution of their shareholdings. However, the company's decision to raise capital through issuing new shares instead of obtaining bank financing is generally within the powers of the company's board of directors and majority shareholders, as long as proper procedures are followed.

The Companies Act, under Article 88, provides pre-emptive rights to existing shareholders when new shares are issued for cash consideration. This means the company must offer the new shares first to the existing shareholders in proportion to their current shareholdings, before offering them to new investors. This gives minority shareholders the opportunity to maintain their percentage ownership by subscribing to the new share issue.

However, Article 88(5) allows the company to restrict or withdraw these pre-emptive rights if authorized by the memorandum or articles of association, and if approved by an extraordinary resolution of the general meeting. So if proper procedures were followed, the company could issue new shares without first offering them to existing shareholders.

The key consideration is whether the share issue was carried out for a proper corporate purpose and benefit, rather than solely to dilute the minority shareholder's stake. The law does not prohibit share issuances that may have a dilutive effect, as long as there is a legitimate business rationale behind it.

Unless there is evidence that the share issue was carried out in bad faith or in violation of the company's constitutional documents or proper procedures, the minority shareholder's claim may not have strong legal grounds. However, the specific circumstances would need to be examined.

Query =>  the reason was just to increase share capital
Answer =>  Based on the information provided in the context documents, if the sole reason for the company to issue new shares and raise additional share capital was to dilute the minority shareholder's stake, without any legitimate business purpose, then the minority shareholder may have grounds to challenge the share issuance.

The Companies Act imposes certain duties on directors when exercising their powers, including the duty to act honestly and in good faith in the best interests of the company (Article 136). Issuing shares solely to dilute a minority shareholder, without any corporate benefit, could potentially be seen as a breach of this duty.

Article 25(1) of the Companies Act states that any increase in the issued share capital shall be decided by an ordinary resolution, unless the company's constitutional documents require a higher voting threshold. However, this power to increase capital is expected to be exercised for proper corporate purposes and not to unfairly prejudice minority shareholders.

If it can be shown that the share issuance was carried out in bad faith, with the primary aim of diluting the minority shareholder's stake rather than for a legitimate business need, the minority shareholder may be able to challenge the decision in court on the grounds of oppression of minority shareholders (Article 402 of the Companies Act).

However, the burden of proof would be on the minority shareholder to demonstrate that the share issuance was carried out improperly and not in the company's best interests. The court would likely examine the specific circumstances, rationale provided by the directors, and whether proper procedures were followed.

Query =>  what remedies does the alleged injured party have?
Answer =>  If a minority shareholder believes that the company issued new shares with the deliberate aim of diluting their shareholding, without a legitimate business purpose, they may have certain remedies available under the Companies Act.

Firstly, the minority shareholder could file a claim in court alleging oppression or unfair prejudice under Article 402 of the Companies Act. This provision allows a shareholder to apply to the court for an order if the company's affairs are being conducted in an oppressive manner or in a way that unfairly prejudices their interests.

If the court finds that the share issuance was carried out in bad faith and primarily to dilute the minority shareholder's stake, without a proper corporate purpose, it may grant relief such as:

1) Regulating the company's affairs in the future (Article 402(1)(a))
2) Requiring the company to buy back the minority shareholder's shares at a fair value (Article 402(1)(b))
3) Awarding compensation to the minority shareholder (Article 402(1)(c))

Additionally, the minority shareholder could potentially claim a breach of directors' duties under Article 136, which requires directors to act honestly and in good faith in the best interests of the company. If it can be shown that the directors acted improperly in issuing shares solely to dilute the minority, the court may order remedies against the directors personally.

However, the burden of proof would be on the minority shareholder to demonstrate that the share issuance lacked a legitimate business rationale and was carried out in bad faith to prejudice their interests.

Query =>  what is the process in the courts
Answer =>  If a minority shareholder wishes to challenge a share issuance by the company on the grounds that it was carried out with the deliberate aim of diluting their shareholding, the process would typically involve filing a claim in the Civil Court.

The relevant provisions under the Companies Act are:

Article 402 - Remedy in case of oppression against minority
This article allows a shareholder to apply to the court for an order if the company's affairs are being conducted in an oppressive manner or in a way that unfairly prejudices their interests as a shareholder.

If the court finds the share issuance was carried out in bad faith to dilute the minority shareholder, without a proper corporate purpose, it may grant relief such as:

1) Regulating the company's affairs in the future (Article 402(1)(a))
2) Requiring the company to buy back the minority shareholder's shares at a fair value (Article 402(1)(b)) 
3) Awarding compensation to the minority shareholder (Article 402(1)(c))

The process would likely involve:

1) The minority shareholder filing an application in the Civil Court under Article 402, alleging oppression/unfair prejudice from the share issuance.

2) The company would file a reply contesting the allegations.

3) The court would hear evidence and submissions from both sides on whether the share issue lacked a legitimate business rationale and was primarily aimed at diluting the minority.

4) If the minority shareholder succeeds, the court can grant appropriate relief per Article 402(1).

The burden of proof would be on the minority shareholder to demonstrate the share issuance was carried out improperly and in bad faith to prejudice their interests.

Query =>  in the case of a listed entity, how much shareholding gives the right to a shareholder to elect a director?
Answer =>  According to the Companies Act of Malta, for listed companies, the right to appoint directors is determined based on the class of shares held by the shareholders and the provisions in the company's memorandum and articles of association.

Specifically, Article 139(3) of the Companies Act states:

"Where the holders of a particular class of shares have the right to appoint one or more directors, in terms of the memorandum and articles of the company, such appointment shall be made by a member or members holding in the aggregate more than fifty per cent in nominal value of the shares represented and entitled to vote at the meeting of the holders of the shares of that class."

This means that if the memorandum and articles of a listed company provide for certain classes of shares to have the right to appoint directors, then the shareholders holding more than 50% of the nominal value of shares in that particular class would have the right to appoint the director(s) allocated to that class.

The key points are:

1) The right to appoint directors is determined by the class of shares held.
2) The specific provisions are laid out in the company's memorandum and articles of association.
3) For the class with the right to appoint directors, shareholders holding over 50% of the nominal value of shares in that class can appoint the director(s).

The Systems Integrator pledges to deliver the Offering, as detailed in the Sales Order or Proposal attached to the Sales Order, with utmost proficiency, professionalism, and in compliance with established industry standards and applicable law. The Systems Integrator's team, equipped with relevant Vendor certifications, will execute the Offering. The Systems Integrator will uphold the principles of integrity, good faith, and fair dealing in all its engagements with the Customer, while strictly observing the stipulations of this Agreement.<br />5.2.	The Systems Integrator hereby acknowledges and consents to the provision of Offering at the Supported Locations. The Parties hereby covenant and agree to collaborate and cooperate in all matters pertaining to the Offering under this Agreement. This collaboration includes, but is not limited to, regular communication, sharing of necessary information, joint problem-solving, and mutual support to achieve the objectives of this Agreement.<br />5.3.	The Customer shall, to the extent required for the provision of the Offering and subject to any obligation the Customer may have to any third party or to applicable laws, furnish all necessary information and afford access to the Supported Locations as may be reasonably required by the Systems Integrator for the effective discharge of its obligations under this Agreement. The Customer acknowledges and accepts that any limitations or delays in providing such necessary information or access may result in delays or limitations in the Systems Integrator's ability to discharge its obligations under this Agreement.<br />5.4.	The Service Provider may, upon receipt of a written request from the Customer through the Change Control Procedure, provide Additional Services to the Customer. The provision of such Additional Services shall be subject to a separate quotation and agreement on the cost thereof prior to the commencement of the Additional Services, as agreed to in writing between the Parties.<br />5.5.	Should the Customer necessitate services beyond the purview of this Agreement ("Out-of-Scope Services"), inclusive of but not limited to services demanded due to emergent situations or other pressing circumstances, such Out-of-Scope Services shall be billed at a rate of ninety five euro (€ 95) excluding VAT per hour per engineer, regardless of whether these services are rendered onsite or remotely.

In addition, the aforementioned out-of-scope charge-out fees are subject to an annual indexation increase of five percent (5%) throughout the term of the Agreement.

The Customer is obliged to ensure that the Installation Sites are aptly prepared and suitable for the implementation of the Products or the delivery of Services by the representatives or engineers of the Systems Integrator. This preparation includes, but is not restricted to, verification of adequate physical space, power supply, network connections, and any additional infrastructure requirements, which should be fulfilled prior to the predetermined installation timeline.

The Customer shall ensure that the necessary Key Customer Personnel are available to facilitate the installation or provision of the services. This may include, but is not limited to, personnel who can provide necessary access, information, or assistance to the System Integrator's engineers or representatives.<br />5.8.	In the event that the Installation Sites are not aptly prepared and suitable for the implementation of the Products or the delivery of Services, or if the necessary Key Customer Personnel are not available as agreed upon by the Parties, the Service Provider may, at its discretion, charge additional fees to cover the costs of rescheduling, additional time, or other resources required due to such delays. The Customer acknowledges and agrees to these potential additional charges.<br />6.	ASSENT TO VENDOR SOFTWARE LICENSING TERMS AND ASSOCIATED RESPONSIBILITIES<br />6.1.	Notwithstanding any other clause in this Agreement, by utilizing the software or systems encompassed under this Agreement, the Customer unconditionally consents to be bound by the licensing terms and conditions specified in the vendor/manufacturer's licensing agreement. Regardless of the Systems Integrator's role in facilitating the initial installation on behalf of and under instruction of the Customer, which may entail assenting to these terms, the Customer's subsequent use of the software constitutes definitive acceptance of such terms and conditions.<br /> <br />6.2.	In the event that the Customer fails to review these terms and conditions, and the Systems Integrator assents to them during the commissioning process, the Customer acknowledges and agrees that they assume all responsibility for the subsequent use and implications of the software under the vendor/manufacturer's terms. The Customer hereby disclaims and releases the Systems Integrator from any claims, liabilities, damages, or responsibilities arising from or connected to the vendor/manufacturer's licensing agreement.<br />6.3.	Prior to acceptance of this Agreement, the Customer is expected to conduct a comprehensive review of the Vendor's licensing, terms, and conditions.

Upon signing, the Customer fully acknowledges and accepts the Vendor's licensing, terms, and conditions.<br />7.	EXCLUSIONS FROM COVER<br />7.1.	Notwithstanding any other clause in this Agreement, the following shall be chargeable to the Customer:<br />7.1.1.	The cost of additional components, equipment, licenses, software or services instructed by the Customer in accordance with the Change Control Procedure to be purchased or otherwise acquired in relation to or as a result of the provision of the Services, unless specified in the Sales Order or the Proposal attached to the Sales Order, as agreed to in writing between the Parties;<br />7.1.2.	Transport, lodging and related costs by Systems Integrator Staff to and from the Customer’s site/s if said site/s are not located in Malta, provided they are approved in advance by the Customer;<br />7.1.3.	Any other costs or disbursements incurred by the Systems Integrator and approved by the Customer; and<br />7.1.4.	Any other Out-of-Scope Services<br />8.	PRICING, PAYMENT, FINANCING AND FINANCIAL CONDITION<br />8.1.	The pricing for the Offering shall be indicated in Sales Order or the Proposal attached to the Sales Order.<br />8.2.	Prices do not include any Value Added Tax (VAT), levies or duties ("Taxes"), unless specified and included in the Sales Order or the Proposal attached to the Sales Order. If the Customer is based outside of Malta, it is the Customer's responsibility to pay any applicable Taxes. For Malta-based companies, VAT or other applicable Taxes will be added to the invoice value unless specified in the Sales Order or the Proposal attached to the Sales Order.<br />8.3.	A partial or full prepayment may be required, to the extent stated in the Sales Order. In such cases, the order will be processed only when such prepayment is received by the Systems Integrator.<br />8.4.	To facilitate certain financing arrangements, the Systems Integrator may assign its receivables from the Customer to a Financial Institution. In such cases, the Customer agrees to fully cooperate with both the Systems Integrator and the Financial Institution, which may include executing additional documentation as required by the Financial Institution. If the Customer opts not to comply with this clause, the Customer undertakes to make a full advance payment encompassing the total value of the Products or Services before the Systems Integrator is obliged to deliver the Products or provide the Professional Services. Under such circumstances, the Systems Integrator will only initiate the processing of any order and commence with the provision of the Offering upon receipt of the entire advance payment.<br />8.5.	The Systems Integrator shall issue invoices to the Customer upon delivery of the Products or completion of the Professional Services, including instances where partial deliveries are made. In such scenarios, the Systems Integrator retains the right to generate invoices for the delivered portion of the Products or services at the time of such delivery or completion, irrespective of whether the delivery constitutes the full extent of all ordered Products or Professional Services. The standard payment conditions stipulate immediate settlement of these invoices upon delivery, unless otherwise specified in the Sales Order or the accompanying Proposal to the Sales Order.<br />8.6.	In the event that the Customer does not fulfil any payment by the established due date, the Systems Integrator is entitled to apply interest to the overdue amount at the maximum rate permitted by applicable law. This interest will accumulate daily from the due date until the actual payment date of the overdue amount. Any payments made by the Customer in this context will first be applied towards covering any accrued interest before being applied to the principal amount. <br />8.7.	Should the payment terms, delineated in the Sales Order or the accompanying Proposal to the Sales Order, allow for the Customer to make phased payments over time, and any such payment becomes overdue by fourteen (14) days, the Systems Integrator reserves the right to demand immediate payment of the total outstanding balance. Upon issuing a written notice to the Customer, the entirety of the outstanding balance will become due and payable within seven (7) days from the date of the notice.<br />8.8.	The Customer shall notify the Systems Integrator in writing within two (2) Business Days of becoming aware of any circumstances that may affect its ability to fulfil its obligations under this Agreement, including financial difficulties, litigation, dissolution, bankruptcy, or any other action that could lead to the winding-up of the company. Upon receiving notice of such circumstances, the Systems Integrator reserves the right to take appropriate measures to protect its interests, including suspending delivery of Products or Professional Services, demanding immediate payment of all amounts due under this Agreement, or terminating this Agreement.<br />8.9.	In the event the Customer makes a claim under warranty provisions of this Agreement, the Customer's obligation to make all due payments under this Agreement remains unaffected. The Customer shall not withhold, reduce, or set-off payments due to the Systems Integrator while a warranty claim is being assessed, processed, or resolved. All payments for Products and Services provided under this Agreement shall continue to be payable in full and on the due date, irrespective of any warranty claim.<br />8.10.	The Systems Integrator reserves the right to review and assess the creditworthiness and financial condition of the Customer at any time during the term of this Agreement. This may include conducting credit checks, obtaining financial information, and monitoring the Customer's payment history.<br />8.10.1.	In the event that adverse activity is detected, including but not limited to a deterioration in the Customer's creditworthiness, a failure to meet payment obligations including payment due to third parties, litigation or any other indication of financial instability, the Systems Integrator may, at its discretion, modify, revoke, or impose additional conditions on the credit terms previously agreed upon.<br />8.10.2.	The Systems Integrator shall provide written notice to the Customer of any changes to the credit terms, including any modifications, revocations, or additional conditions. The notice shall specify the reasons for the changes and the effective date of the revised credit terms.<br />8.10.3.	In the instance of any alteration, rescission, or introduction of supplementary stipulations to the credit terms, the Systems Integrator holds the discretion to demand settlement of all outstanding dues and mandate immediate remittance of the total outstanding balance. However, notwithstanding such changes to the credit terms, the Customer may continue to leverage the credit terms, conditional upon the provision of an irrevocable bank guarantee from a reputable financial institution. The Customer is obligated to comply with the modified credit terms as communicated by the Systems Integrator. Failure to abide by these adjusted credit terms may precipitate the cessation of further credit extension or provoke the Systems Integrator to undertake other appropriate actions.<br />8.10.4.	The Customer acknowledges and agrees that the Systems Integrator's assessment of creditworthiness and financial condition is an ongoing process, and the Systems Integrator may periodically review and reassess the credit terms throughout the duration of this Agreement.<br />8.10.5.	The Systems Integrator shall not be liable for any losses, damages, or claims arising from the modification, revocation, or imposition of additional conditions on the credit terms, unless such liability arises from the Systems Integrator's negligence or breach of applicable laws.<br />8.10.6.	The provisions of this clause shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement, to the extent necessary to give effect to its terms and purposes.<br />9.	CHANGE CONTROL PROCEDURE<br />9.1.	In the event that either Party seeks to modify the scope or performance of the Services or Products ("Change Request"), such Party shall submit a written request to the other Party outlining the intended changes. The Party receiving the Change Request shall undertake a review of the proposal and shall respond in writing within a reasonable timeframe, not to exceed fifteen (15) Business Days. This response shall delineate the impact of the proposed alterations on the costs, timelines, or other aspects pertinent to the Agreement. The terms of the Agreement shall remain unaltered until both Parties have provided written consent to the proposed changes and the corresponding adjustments to the Agreement's stipulations. Any changes that are mutually agreed upon shall result in an addendum that outlines these revisions. This addendum shall be executed by both Parties and shall form an integral part of the Agreement.<br />10.	RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PARTIES<br />10.1.	This Agreement shall not be interpreted or construed to create an association, joint venture or partnership between the Parties or to impose any partnership obligation or liability upon any party.<br />10.2.	Each Party shall be responsible for the management, direction and control of its employees and sub-contractors and such employees and sub-contractors shall not be deemed to be employees or sub-contractors of the other Party.<br />11.	SUB-CONTRACTING<br />11.1.	The Systems Integrator reserves the right to sub-contract any or all obligations under this Agreement to third parties, including but not limited to manufacturers, vendors, other suitable entities, or Affiliated Companies. Despite any such sub-contracting arrangements, the Systems Integrator remains the principal entity accountable for all duties and obligations stipulated within this Agreement.<br />11.2.	The Systems Integrator ensures that any sub-contractor, including any Affiliated Companies, will be suitably qualified and competent to carry out the tasks assigned in full accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Should there be a breach of this Agreement caused by any sub-contractor or Affiliated Company, such breach will be deemed as a breach by the Systems Integrator, and the Systems Integrator will be held accountable accordingly.<br />12.	NON-SOLICITATION<br />12.1.	The Parties agree that they shall not, during the term of this Agreement, and for a period of two (2) years thereafter, recruit or request services from employees of the other Party without the prior written consent of the other Party. In the event that a Party wishes to recruit or engage the services of any of the other Party’s employees, it may do so by notifying the other Party in writing with the soliciting Party agreeing to pay an engagement fee of two hundred and fifty thousand euro (€250,000) excluding VAT, per employee, to the other Party, unless both Parties agree in writing to waive this clause.<br />13.	FORCE MAJEURE<br />13.1.	No liability shall be incurred by either Party towards the other Party for any breach of the Agreement that arises due to a Force Majeure Event, given that the Party not affected is satisfied that the Affected Party has taken all reasonable steps to mitigate the effects of the Force Majeure Event. In such cases, the obligations of the Affected Party under this Agreement that are prevented, hindered, or delayed by the Force Majeure Event are suspended for the duration of the event, and the Affected Party is granted a reasonable extension of time to perform such obligations.<br />13.2.	In the event of a Force Majeure Event, the Affected Party shall provide prompt written notice to the other Party, detailing the nature of the event, the anticipated duration of the delay, and the reasonable steps being taken to mitigate the impact of the event.<br />13.3.	The Affected Party shall use reasonable efforts to mitigate the effects of the event and resume the performance of its obligations as soon as reasonably practicable.<br />13.4.	If a Force Majeure Event continues for a period of one hundred and eighty (180) days or more, either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement, without any liability or obligation other than for payment for the Products or Services delivered up to the date of termination, such date being no earlier than when the written notice was given to the other Party.<br />13.5.	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, a Force Majeure Event shall not relieve the Customer from the obligation to make payments for any Products or Services already delivered by the Systems Integrator prior to the occurrence of the Force Majeure Event.<br />13.6.	During the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, the Parties shall consult and cooperate in good faith to determine the best course of action to minimize the impact of the event on the performance of this Agreement.<br />13.7.	In the event that the Systems Integrator provides credit terms or payment plans exceeding thirty (30) days, the Customer shall be obliged to take out appropriate insurance coverage to mitigate the potential risks associated with Force Majeure events. The Customer shall make commercially reasonable efforts to obtain insurance coverage that adequately covers its obligations under this Agreement in the event of Force Majeure risks. The insurance coverage should aim to provide protection against all reasonably foreseeable risks and be obtained from reputable insurance providers. The Customer shall promptly provide the Systems Integrator with proof of insurance coverage upon request.<br />13.8.	The Systems Integrator reserves the right to review and adjust the credit terms offered to the Customer in light of any Force Majeure events or changes in the Customer's insurance coverage. The Parties shall engage in good faith discussions to address any necessary adjustments to credit terms, taking into consideration the risks associated with Force Majeure events.<br />14.	PRODUCT WARRANTY<br />14.1.	Unless otherwise explicitly stated in the Sales Order or the Proposal attached thereto, the Systems Integrator provides a limited warranty for the Products, commencing from the date of delivery and lasting for a period of seven (7) days. It is expressly acknowledged that the Systems Integrator does not provide any warranty, whether express or implied, with respect to the Software products. Any warranty claims pertaining to the Software products shall be the sole responsibility of the respective Vendors, and the Systems Integrator assumes no liability or obligation in relation thereto.<br />14.2.	During the warranty period, the Systems Integrator warrants that the Hardware will be free from material defects in material and workmanship under normal use and service, provided that the Customer fulfils its obligations as outlined herein. The warranty is extended solely to the original Customer and is non-transferable.<br />14.3.	The warranty covers any malfunction or failure of the Hardware resulting from manufacturing defects, faulty workmanship, or non-conformity to the manufacturer's or vendor's specifications. In the event of such a defect, the Systems Integrator or the manufacturer, at their discretion, will provide appropriate remedies, which may include repair, replacement, or refund of the defective Hardware. The warranty specifically excludes the following:<br />14.3.1.	Damage or defects resulting from improper installation, use, handling, or storage of the Hardware by the Customer;<br />14.3.2.	Any modifications, alterations, or repairs made to the Hardware by parties other than the Systems Integrator or authorized service providers;<br />14.3.3.	Normal wear and tear, including but not limited to cosmetic damages, scratches, or dents that do not affect the functionality of the Hardware;<br />14.3.4.	Damage caused by accidents, negligence, misuse, abuse, or acts beyond the Systems Integrator's control, including but not limited to fire, flood, power surges, or electrical disturbances;<br />14.3.5.	Compatibility issues arising from the Customer's use of the Hardware in conjunction with other hardware, software, or peripherals not recommended or approved by the manufacturer; and<br />14.3.6.	Loss of data, software, or other digital content stored on the Hardware.<br />14.4.	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the warranty period for the Hardware that include batteries, is limited to seven (7) days by default and ninety (90) days maximum irrespective of any warranty period specified in the Sales Order or the Proposal attached to the Sales Order or the product’s standard warranty duration. Therefore, if for example, the product is offered a two-year warranty period, the warranty period on the battery component is nevertheless limited to ninety (90) days.<br />14.5.	The Customer shall be responsible for maintaining all-risk insurance coverage for the Products while they are being repaired under this warranty. The Systems Integrator shall not be held liable for any damage or loss to the Products that occurs during this period.<br />14.6.	The Systems Integrator shall not be responsible for the loss of any data stored on the Products. The Customer is advised to back up all data before returning any Product for repair.<br />14.7.	The Systems Integrator shall not be responsible for any loss of business or other consequential damages arising from the use, misuse, or inability to use the Products.<br />14.8.	The Systems Integrator is under no obligation to provide any courtesy replacement equipment while the Customer's Hardware is being repaired unless otherwise stated in the Sales Order or the Proposal attached to the Sales Order.<br />14.9.	The Systems Integrator does not guarantee a specific timeframe for the provision of replacement parts or the completion of repairs, unless otherwise specified in the Sales Order or the proposal attached to the Sales Order.<br />14.10.	The Systems Integrator relies on the warranties provided by the Vendors of the Products. In cases where the warranty is not offered directly between the Customer and the Vendor, the Systems Integrator will make a claim to the Vendor on behalf of the Customer. It is the Vendor who decides what remediation is necessary and what the Customer is entitled to under the Vendor's warranty. The Systems Integrator does not independently provide any warranties and all warranty claims are subject to the terms and conditions of the Vendor's warranty. It is the responsibility of the Customer to familiarize themselves with the terms and conditions of the Vendor's warranty prior to making a purchase.<br />14.11.	Any replacement parts provided under this warranty may be new or refurbished, at the discretion of the Vendor.<br />14.12.	In the event of a Parts-Only Warranty, the parts shall be made available for collection by the Customer at a location established by the Systems Integrator. Alternatively, the parts may be shipped or delivered to the Customer, with all shipping or delivery costs and taxes to be borne by the Customer.<br />14.13.	In the case of Products that are sold with a direct Vendor support contract or warranty, the warranty will be provided directly by the Vendor. In such case, the Customer acknowledges and agrees that it will need to interact directly with the Vendor for the purposes of warranty claims and support. The Systems Integrator does not provide any additional or separate warranty for these Products.<br />14.14.	The Customer agrees and acknowledges that the decision of the Vendor with regard to warranty claims is final. The Systems Integrator shall not be responsible for and will not have any obligations with respect to the decisions made by the Vendor regarding the warranty claims.<br />14.15.	The Systems Integrator's liability for any defective Product is limited to the repair or replacement of the Product or the refund of the purchase price, at the Systems Integrator's option. The Systems Integrator will not be liable for any other damages or losses, including, but not limited to, loss of use, loss of profits, or loss of data, whether in an action in contract or tort or based on a warranty, arising out of or in connection with any use of the Product.<br />14.16.	Unless otherwise specified in the Sales Order or the Proposal attached to the Sales Order, all warranties offered are on a "return to base" basis. The costs for transportation of the Products to and from the base for the purposes of warranty repairs are to be borne by the Customer. The Systems Integrator may, at its discretion, facilitate transportation to and from the base. A quote for such transportation services will be provided to the Customer in advance, and such services will be provided only upon the Customer's acceptance of the quote for the transportation fees.<br />14.17.	The warranties under this Agreement do not extend to any Software elements, including but not limited to, software applications, drivers, operating systems, and firmware, regardless of whether they are included with the Product or installed subsequently. This includes issues stemming from the compatibility of the Products with other hardware or software components, systems, or configurations used by the Customer, for which the Systems Integrator bears no responsibility. Moreover, the sale of software products, licensing, or use entitlements by the Systems Integrator comes without warranties, performance guarantees, or any other form of assurance, except as expressly outlined in the applicable software license agreement or any other agreement between the Customer and the software vendor/manufacturer. Any disputes related to software products, licensing, or use entitlements shall be handled directly between the Customer and the Vendor, with the Systems Integrator bearing no responsibility for such disputes. The Systems Integrator is deemed to have fulfilled its obligations under this Agreement upon making any license key or equivalent, or access to such keys, available to the Customer in accordance with the Sales Order or the Proposal attached to the Sales Order.<br />14.18.	The sale of Software, Licenses, or use entitlements by the Systems Integrator shall be without warranties, performance guarantees, or any other form of assurance, except as expressly set forth in the applicable software license agreement or other agreement between the Customer and the vendor. The Customer acknowledges that any disputes related to software products, licensing, or use entitlements shall be managed directly between the Customer and the Vendor, and the Systems Integrator shall not be responsible for any such disputes. The Systems Integrator shall be deemed to have fulfilled its obligations under this Agreement once any license key or equivalent, or access to such keys, is made available to the Customer in accordance with the Sales Order or the Proposal attached to the Sales Order.<br />14.19.	In the event of a breach of these warranty provisions by the Systems Integrator, the Systems Integrator's sole liability and the Customer's exclusive remedy will be, at the Systems Integrator's option, to repair or replace the defective Product or refund the purchase price for the defective Product.<br />14.20.	Except for the warranty set forth in this section, the Systems Integrator disclaims all other warranties, whether express or implied, including without limitation, any implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, to the maximum extent permitted by law.<br />15.	HARDWARE REPAIR – SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLAs)<br />15.1.	By default, the Systems Integrator provides Hardware repair services on a best effort basis. The Systems Integrator will use reasonable efforts to repair the Hardware as quickly as possible, but does not guarantee a specific timeframe for the completion of repairs.<br />15.2.	If the Systems Integrator is offering a specific SLA for Hardware repair to the Customer, this will be explicitly specified in the Sales Order or the Proposal attached to the Sales Order. The terms of such SLA, including the guaranteed response or repair times, will be set out in the Sales Order or the Proposal attached to the Sales Order.<br />15.3.	The SLAs for Hardware repair are applicable only to the repair of Hardware components of the Products. They do not cover any Software elements, including but not limited to, firmware, software applications, drivers, or operating systems, whether included with the Product or installed subsequently.<br />15.4.	The SLAs do not cover issues arising from the compatibility of the Products with other hardware or software components, systems, or configurations used by the Customer. The Systems Integrator is not responsible for ensuring compatibility between the Products and any other hardware or software used by the Customer.<br />16.	PROFESSIONAL SERVICES – SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLAs)<br />16.1.	Pursuant to standard operational procedure, the Systems Integrator furnishes Professional Services grounded in a principle of best effort, employing reasonable measures to respond to service requests in a timely manner without, however, proffering a definitive timeframe for such response.<br />16.2.

These Professional Services may include offerings designed to monitor, optimise and secure the Customer's technological framework.<br />19.2.

This individual will serve as the Systems Integrator's principal point of communication and collaboration with the Customer. The Customer shall communicate the details of the Key Contact Person via email to enterprisesupport@fonicom.com and notices@fonicom.com.<br />19.3.	The Key Contact Person will be accountable for the oversight of all service requests that fall under this agreement on behalf of the Customer, which could encompass Technical Support Requests, Service Requests, Change Requests, Warranty Requests, or Incident Requests. They will be responsible for providing comprehensive information pertinent to the understanding, diagnosis, and remediation of issues.<br />19.4.

As such, the Systems Integrator will not be held liable for any delay, failure, or deficiency in the provision of the Managed Services that results from the unavailability or unresponsiveness of the Key Contact Person or other technical resources from the Customer's side.<br />20.

Delay in delivery will not entitle the Customer to cancel the order unless the delay exceeds ninety (90) Business Days.<br />20.2.

The Customer shall be deemed to have accepted the Hardware unless the Customer notifies the Systems Integrator in writing of any non-conformity within three (3) days from receipt.

The Customer’s representative shall sign the Delivery Note to confirm receipt of the goods, and such signature shall constitute acceptance of the goods. <br />20.5.	If the Parties have entered into a separate services agreement for a specific project, the acceptance of services for that project shall be governed by the terms of that agreement. If no separate services agreement is in force, the Customer shall be deemed to have accepted the Professional Services upon receipt of the invoice unless the Customer notifies the Systems Integrator in writing of any non-conformity within three (3) days from the date of delivery of the invoice. If the Customer notifies the Systems Integrator of any non-conformity within the three (3) day period, the Systems Integrator shall have the opportunity to cure any non-conformity by re-performing the Professional Services, as applicable.<br />20.6.

Answer =>  Based on the context provided, I did not find any provisions in this Sales Agreement that directly contradict or violate the Civil Code of Malta. The agreement appears to be a standard commercial contract governing the sale of products and services between the Systems Integrator (Fonicom) and the Customer.

However, it's important to note that my analysis is limited to the excerpts provided, and I cannot definitively confirm compliance with all aspects of Maltese law without reviewing the complete agreement and relevant legal provisions. Additionally, as an AI system, I cannot provide legal advice or make definitive determinations regarding the legality of contractual clauses.

If you have specific concerns about the legality or enforceability of any provisions in this agreement, I would recommend consulting with a qualified legal professional who can review the agreement in its entirety and provide a comprehensive assessment based on their expertise in Maltese contract law.

F’dan ir-rigward, l-Atturi presentaw il-kuntratti talbejgħ mill-bidu sakemm waslet għand Mark Borda u dawn huma:<br />1. Kuntratt ta’ bejgħ datat 29 ta’ Awwissu 1989 bejn M. and S.<br />Developers Limited flimkien ma’ Genco General Commercial and<br />Industrial Enterprises li biegħu lil Joseph Debono, fl-atti tan-Nutar Victor<br />John Bisazza, (a fol. 99 sa 116 u a fol. 117 sa 132 u a fol. 194 sa 196).<br />F’dan il-kuntratt insibu illi “the said pent house flat having in common<br />with the other apartments in the said Block, the ownership of the<br />entrance to the Block, Hallway, stairs, stairwell, staircase, lift, lift space,<br />shafts and landings.” Inoltre’ sa frjn jirrigwarda l-arja ta’ fuq il-penthouse<br />jipprovdi illi “The ownership of the roof of the Block and the said Pent<br />House flat, including relative airspace of both, is also being transferred to<br />the Purchaser, however the roof of the Pent house Flat shall retain on it<br />the water tanks (one for each flat including the Pent house Flat) and a<br />Comunal Television Aerial.

Pero’ dan il-ftehim ma jistax imur kontra l-kuntratti hawn<br />fuq kollha imsemmija li kollha jindikaw b’mod ċar li s-sid tal-penthouse<br />dejjem għandu d-dritt illi jibni sulari oħrajn, bid-dritt tal-użu għas-sidien<br />tal-appartamenti l-oħra.<br />Li kieku l-ladies cleaning room hi komuni bejn is-sidien kollha allura s-sid<br />tal-penthouse ma seta’ qatt jingħata d-dritt li jaqbad u jibni sular ieħor<br />mingħajr il-permess tas-sidien l-oħra, u f’ebda wiehed mill-kuntratti talAtturi ma hemm xi klwasola li tipprojbixxi dan, liema klawsola ma<br />tissemma’ fl-ebda kuntratt hawn fuq imsemmi. Li kieku tali din il-ladies<br />cleaning room kellha tkun komuni, din kienet tkun imsemmija fil-kuntratt<br />bħal ma ssemma’ il-lift shaft, fost oħrajn.<br />2. Bil-kuntratt datat 10 ta’ Diċembru 1996 fl-atti tan-Nutar Dr. Pierre<br />Cassar, u liema kopja tinsab a fol. 190 sa 19, Joseph Debono biegħ limsemmija penthouse lil Mark Borda li hija nnumerata 15 fil-blokka talappartamenti hawn fuq imsemmija.

Evidenza oħra fil-proċess<br />Apparti l-kuntratti hekk ippreżentati, din il-Qorti wkoll qieset ukoll il-provi loħra kollha li ma humiex ta’ natura dokumentali.<br />a. L-affidavit tar-rikorrenti Victor Sant<br />Victor Sant, fl-affidavit tiegħu tat-23 ta’ April 2019, jgħid illi “din il-kamra<br />tas-seftura inbniet mal-blokka ta’ appartamenti in kwistjoni”. Il-Qorti<br />tifhem illi ġjaladarba l-arja hija sovraposta ghall-penthouse, din il-kamra<br />ma setgħet qatt inbniet mingħar il-kunsens ta’ sid il-penthouse. Dan ilkunsens ma jirrisulta minn imkien. Victor Sant reġa’ xehed fl-14 ta’<br />Diċembru 2021, u għid illi hu xtara qabel Joseph Debono (a’ fol 376 sa<br />383). Jiftakar il-kamra tas-seftura mibnija. Pero’ fil-kuntratt tiegħu ma<br />hemm ebda referenza għal din il-kamra. Din il-Qorti hi konvinta illi li kieku<br />kien dan il-każ, Victor Sant kien ikun ċert li din il-kamra kienet tissemma’<br />bħala li tagħmel parti mill-partijiet l-oħra li jiffurmaw il-komun.<br />Rik. Nru. 266/19TA<br />29<br />Ġaladarba li l-Atturi qegħdin jinsistu li din il-kamra tagħmel parti millpartijiet kommuni huwa interessanti li wieħed iħares lejn id-definizzjoni ta’<br />x’inhuma prtijiet komuni skond art 5 tal-Kap 398 :<br />“Kemm-il darba ma jirriżultax xort’oħra mit-titolu tas-sidien tal-oqsma<br />separati, jew sakemm ma jkunx hemm qbil mod ieħor bejn il-condomini<br />b’att pubbliku, il-partijiet komuni ta’ condominium huma dawn li ġejjin,<br />ukoll jekk wieħed jew iżjed mill-condomini ma jagħmilx użu minnu:<br />(a) l-art li fuqha jkun mibni l-condominium, il-pedamenti,il-ħitan ta’ barra,<br />inklużi l-ħitan diviżorji komuni mal-fondi ta’ biswit, is-soqfa, ix-xaftijiet, ittaraġ, il-bibien ta’ dħul komuni, intrati, trombi tat-taraġ, btieħi, ġonna, l-arja<br />li tiġi fuq il-proprjetà kollha u b’mod ġenerali, kull parti oħra tal-proprjetà li<br />għandha għan li tintuża b’mod komuni;<br />(b) il-partijiet li jintużaw bħala intrata u bħala kamra tal-ħasil komuni u lpartijiet li jintużaw bħala porter’s, għat-tagħmir ta’ central heating, u għal<br />kull faċilità oħra li għandha għan li tintuża b’mod komuni;<br />U<br />(ċ) id-dwal, bjar, tankijiet, akwedotti, drenaġġi, pajpijiet tal-katusi tal-ilma,<br />kull stallazzjoni għall-ilma, gass,elettriku, tisħin u servizzi oħra simili sa<br />fejn dawk l-istallazzjonijiet jaqsmu lejn il-proprjetà esklużiva ta’ kull<br />condominus, u kull opra, stallazzjoni u oġġett ta’ kull għamla li tkun li<br />Rik.

Din iċ-ċirkostanza torbot ma’ dak li<br />xehed Joseph Debono meta xehed illi bnieha hu din il-kamra wara li xtara<br />l-penthouse u li bnieha fil-fatt fuq in-naħa l-oħra tal-bejt li ma hux milqut ilftehim imsemmi (a’ fol. 321 sa 327 ara ukoll a fol. 340 sa 343).<br />Xehed ukoll Philip Tabone fit-2 ta’ Mejju 2022, a fol. 391 sa 399 li qal ċar<br />u tond li, għalkemm huwa kien wieħed li bena din il-blokka ta’<br />appartamenti, ma jiftakarx kienx hemm din il-kamra tas-seftura fuq il-bejt.<br />Qal ukoll illi m’għandux aċċess għall-imsemmija kamra u huwa biss Mark<br />Borda illi għandu aċċess (a’ fol 391 sa 399).<br />Mill-permessi relattivi tal-bini jirrisulta li setghet tinbena pent house iżda<br />ma setgħetx tinbena washroom fuq il-pent house li jinsabu fosthom a fol.<br />423 u 424). Insibu ittra datata 23 ta’ Mejju 1989, u ċioe’ qabel ma xtara lpenthouse Joseph Debono. Il-Perit Sebastian Grima, illi jiġi n-neputi talPerit Italo Raniolo, li kien il-Perit tal-blokka xehed illi mid-dokumentazzjoni<br />jidher illi l-penthouse ma kinitx mibnija qabel it-23 ta’ Mejju 1989 (a’ fol.<br />448 sa 452). Dan il-fatt ikompli jaghti affidament għax-xhieda talkonvenut Borda peress li xtara wara dik id-data u preċiżament fl-10 ta’<br />Diċembru 1996.<br />Inoltre’ Genco, General Commercial and Industrial Enterprises Limited (C<br />2819), li kienet waħda mill-iżvilluppaturi tal-imsemmija blokka wkoll tinsisti<br />illi din il-kamra tas-seftura hi ta’ l-intimat Mark Borda, u dan skond in-nota<br />Rik.

Answer =>  Based on the extensive review of the court case provided, it appears that the primary issue revolves around the ownership and rights associated with a room referred to as the "ladies cleaning room" located on the roof level of a block of apartments known as Tower Point Mansions in Sliema. The applicants (rikorrenti) are contesting that this room should be considered a common part of the property, accessible to all apartment owners, while the respondent (intimat), Mark Borda, claims it as his property, being part of the penthouse airspace he owns.

The court must consider the evidence presented, including the affidavits, testimonies, and the original contracts of sale (kuntratti ta' bejgħ) for the apartments and the penthouse. The contracts seem to indicate that the roof space over the penthouse, which includes the "ladies cleaning room," is the property of the penthouse owner and not a common area shared by all apartment owners. This is supported by the fact that the contracts for the apartments do not specifically mention the "ladies cleaning room" as a common area, and the airspace above the penthouse is explicitly stated as belonging to the penthouse owner.

Furthermore, the court has considered the affidavits and testimonies of various parties, including Victor Sant and Austin Demajo, as well as the observations made by the court during an on-site visit. The evidence suggests that the "ladies cleaning room" has been exclusively used and maintained by Mark Borda for a significant period, further supporting his claim to the property.

Given the information presented, the court's decision should reflect the findings that the "ladies cleaning room" is indeed the property of the penthouse owner, Mark Borda, and not a common area. Consequently, the court should uphold Borda's rights to the room and deny the applicants' claims to access and keys to the room. The court should also address the reconventional claims (talbiet rikonvenzjonali) made by Borda, granting or denying them based on the established ownership of the "ladies cleaning room" and the rights outlined in the respective contracts.

The court's decision should be detailed, providing clear reasoning for each point of contention and the basis for the ruling on each claim and reconventional claim, taking into account the legal principles and evidence presented in the case.

Query =>  what taxes are due when a company dealing in property sells a property?
Answer =>  When a company dealing in property sells a property in Malta, several taxes may be due, depending on the specific circumstances of the sale. The primary taxes to consider are:

1. Provisional Tax: According to Article 43 of the Income Tax Act (Cap. 123), when a person (which includes a company) makes a transfer of property, they are required to remit a provisional tax payment to the Commissioner for Revenue. This payment is generally equivalent to 7% of the higher of the market value and the consideration for the transfer. This provisional tax payment must be made within fifteen days of the transfer.

2. Final Tax: The provisional tax paid may be adjusted when the final tax is calculated on the actual gains or profits derived from the transfer. The final tax rate will depend on the specific provisions of the Income Tax Act that apply to the transaction.

3. Additional Duty: If the company selling the property is a property company (as defined in the Income Tax Act), which holds directly or indirectly shares in another company with 75% or more of its assets consisting of immovable property (excluding current assets other than immovable property), an additional duty may be due. This duty is increased by three euro for every one hundred euro or part thereof of the amount or value of the consideration or the real value of the marketable security, whichever is the higher.

It is important to note that there are specific exemptions and different rates that may apply under certain conditions, such as transfers of property that are not subject to tax under the provisions of articles 5 and 12 of the Income Tax Act, or in the case of transfers to which article 5(9A) or 27G of the Income Tax Act applies.

For accurate calculation and remittance of taxes due on the sale of property by a company, it is essential to consider the relevant provisions of the Income Tax Act and any other applicable rules or regulations.

Query =>  what taxes are applicable to transfer or property from the sellers side
Answer =>  According to Maltese Company Law, specifically the Income Tax Act (Cap. 123), there are taxes applicable to the transfer of property from the seller's side. The tax rate depends on various factors. For transfers made on or after November 1, 2005, the tax rate is generally 8% of the transfer value. However, there are exceptions and different rates for specific situations.

If the transfer is a transfer of property that was acquired by the seller through a transfer causa mortis (inheritance) after November 24, 1992, or through a donation made more than five years before the transfer, the tax rate is 12% of the excess of the transfer value over its acquisition value.

It's important to note that if the property transferred consists of a property forming part of a project, the 12% tax rate does not apply. Additionally, the transferor can elect to apply a different tax rate by making a declaration to the notary at the time of the transfer deed's publication.

For transfers of property acquired through a donation made five years or less before the transfer, the tax rate is determined based on specific provisions.

It's crucial to consult with a legal professional or tax advisor for specific advice tailored to your situation.

Query =>  i own a plot of land. the previous owner is stating that part of the land what not transferred, but the site plans clearly indicate it was. He is threathing to erect a wall to split the boundary. What remedies do i have to stop him
Answer =>  Based on the information provided in the Civil Code of Malta, if you own a plot of land and the previous owner is claiming that part of the land was not transferred to you, despite the site plans indicating otherwise, you have certain legal rights and remedies to address the situation.

Firstly, you have the right to compel your neighbor to fix the boundaries of your adjoining tenements at joint expense, as stated in Article 325 of the Civil Code: "Every owner may compel his neighbour to fix, at joint expense, by visible and permanent marks, the boundaries of their adjoining tenements."

If the previous owner is threatening to erect a wall on what you believe to be your property, you may also invoke your rights under Article 326, which states that "Every owner may enclose his tenement, saving any right of easement to which other parties may be entitled." This means that you have the right to enclose your property, but you must also respect any established easements.

Furthermore, if the previous owner proceeds with the construction without your consent and it affects your property, you may have recourse under Article 419, which outlines that it is not lawful for one neighbor to cause any new work to be affixed to or to lean against a common wall without the consent of the other neighbor, or without having first determined by means of experts the necessary measures to be taken to prevent the new work from injuriously affecting the rights of the other neighbor.

In the event of a dispute over the boundary, you may need to seek a determination by experts or the courts to establish the correct boundary line based on the site plans and any other relevant documentation.

It is important to note that these provisions are designed to ensure that the rights of property owners are respected and that any disputes are resolved in a manner that is fair and legal. If the previous owner proceeds with the construction of a wall without proper legal basis or without respecting your rights as the current owner, you may need to take legal action to enforce your rights and prevent any unlawful encroachment on your property.

Query =>  is there cause for a criminal complaint?
Answer =>  In the context of Maltese Company Law, the situation you described regarding the previous owner threatening to erect a wall to split the boundary of your land does not inherently constitute a criminal matter. Criminal complaints typically involve actions that are considered offenses against the state or public order. 

However, if the previous owner's actions amount to a specific criminal offense under Maltese law, such as trespassing or willful damage to property, you may have grounds for a criminal complaint. For instance, if the previous owner enters your property without permission and starts construction, this could potentially be considered trespassing. Similarly, if the previous owner damages your property in the process, this could be considered willful damage.

Under the Criminal Code [CAP. 9], Article 339, trespassing is defined as "Whosoever, without any lawful cause, shall enter into any dwelling-house, or into the offices, out-houses, or enclosed yards, gardens or grounds thereto attached, or into any closed or fenced immovable property, or shall be found therein, after having been warned to depart therefrom, shall, on conviction, be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months or to a fine (multa)."

If the previous owner's actions do not fall under a specific criminal offense, the matter would likely be considered a civil dispute, which would be handled through civil litigation rather than criminal proceedings.

It is important to consult the specific provisions of the Criminal Code and other relevant laws to determine whether the actions of the previous owner constitute a criminal offense. If you believe that a criminal offense has been committed, you may report the matter to the police for further investigation.

Query =>  can i have an employment agreement, wherin, a bonus and salary level is contingent on the employee staying on with the company for a period of 5 years. so for example if the employee leaves after 2 years he will have to pay back the bonus and 50% of the salary
Answer =>  In Maltese Company Law, it is permissible to have employment agreements that include conditions related to bonuses and salary levels contingent on the employee remaining with the company for a specified period. Such clauses are generally known as 'golden handcuffs' and are designed to retain key employees. However, the enforceability of these clauses must be consistent with Maltese employment law, particularly with regard to the protection of employees' rights.

Regarding the repayment of bonuses, it is possible to include a clause in the employment agreement that requires the repayment of bonuses if the employee leaves before a certain period. This is often structured as a form of deferred compensation or conditional bonus, where the employee's right to the bonus vests over time.

As for the salary, requiring an employee to pay back a portion of their salary upon leaving the company before a certain time may be more complex. Under Maltese law, the wage is considered the basic entitlement for work performed, and clauses that infringe upon the right to receive wages for work done may be viewed as potentially unfair or penal in nature and could be subject to scrutiny by the courts or employment tribunals.

It is important to note that any such clauses should be clearly stated in the employment contract, and the employee should be fully aware of these conditions before entering into the agreement. The terms should be reasonable, and not so onerous as to effectively trap an employee in employment against their will or create an undue financial burden upon leaving.

In the context of Maltese law, the Employment and Industrial Relations Act (CAP. 452) provides for the protection of wages and outlines the conditions under which an employer may make deductions from wages. Any agreement that contravenes the provisions of this Act, particularly those that protect the payment of wages, may be considered null and void.

Therefore, while certain conditions related to bonuses may be enforceable, the idea of requiring an employee to pay back 50% of their salary may not be enforceable under Maltese law, as it could be seen as a penalty that infringes upon the employee's right to wages earned for work performed.

It is advisable to carefully draft such clauses to ensure they comply with Maltese employment law and to consider the potential implications of enforcing such terms. Employers should also be mindful of the balance between creating incentives for employees to stay and potentially creating a disincentive for potential employees who may view such terms as overly restrictive.

Query =>  the idea is this. This employee will be running a business unit. the business unit will require substantial investment. the employee will have a bonus tied on the performance of the unit. They employee is a key person, therefore if he leaves before 5 years it will render the investment null. how do I go about it, give me ideas
Answer =>  In Maltese Company Law, to protect the company's investment in a business unit that is heavily reliant on a key employee, you can consider several strategies within the employment agreement to incentivize the employee to stay for the desired period:

1. **Performance Bonus Structure**: You can design a performance-based bonus structure that rewards the employee incrementally over the five-year period. For example, a portion of the bonus could be allocated for each year of service, with the amount increasing each year to encourage retention. This way, the bonus becomes fully vested at the end of the five-year period, providing a strong financial incentive for the employee to remain with the company.

2. **Long-term Incentive Plans (LTIPs)**: Consider implementing LTIPs such as stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs), or other equity-based incentives that vest over the five-year period. These plans give the employee a stake in the company's future success, aligning their interests with the company's long-term performance.

3. **Deferred Compensation**: You can set up a deferred compensation plan where a portion of the employee's salary or bonus is deferred and paid out at the end of the five-year period. This deferred amount acts as a retention tool, as the employee would forfeit this compensation if they leave before the end of the term.

4. **Clawback Provisions**: Include clawback provisions in the employment agreement that allow the company to reclaim a portion of the bonuses paid if the employee leaves before the five-year period. These provisions must be carefully drafted to ensure they are enforceable and do not contravene any employment protections under Maltese law.

5. **Non-compete and Non-solicitation Clauses**: Incorporate non-compete and non-solicitation clauses that restrict the employee from joining competitors or soliciting clients and staff for a certain period after leaving the company. These clauses can protect the company's investment by limiting the employee's ability to immediately work for a competitor.

6. **Tailored Training and Development**: Offer a personalized training and development program that spans the five-year period. This investment in the employee's professional growth can increase their loyalty and commitment to the company.

7. **Clear Communication of Expectations**: Ensure that the terms of the employment agreement, especially those related to the investment in the business unit and the importance of the employee's role, are clearly communicated and understood. This transparency can foster a sense of responsibility and commitment.

It is crucial that any terms included in the employment agreement comply with Maltese employment law and are reasonable, clear, and agreed upon by both parties. The agreement should not impose undue hardship on the employee or be seen as a penalty for leaving the company. Instead, it should provide fair compensation and incentives that align the employee's interests with the long-term success of the business unit and the company as a whole.

Remember, while these strategies can be effective, they must be balanced with the need to maintain a positive working relationship and a supportive work environment. High employee turnover can often be mitigated by fostering a culture that values and rewards loyalty and long-term commitment.

Query =>  check the legality of all of the 6 points above in detail
Answer =>  I apologize for any confusion, but as an AI developed to provide information on Maltese Company Law, I must clarify that the previous responses provided were not based on specific provisions from Maltese Company Law. The strategies mentioned, such as performance bonus structures, long-term incentive plans, deferred compensation, clawback provisions, non-compete and non-solicitation clauses, and tailored training and development, are general business practices that can be considered in employment agreements. However, their legality and enforceability would need to be assessed within the context of Maltese employment law, specifically the Employment and Industrial Relations Act (CAP. 452).

To address the legality of the points mentioned in detail:

1. **Performance Bonus Structure**: The legality of a performance bonus structure would depend on the specific terms and conditions set out in the employment contract. The Employment and Industrial Relations Act does not specifically prohibit performance-based bonuses, but any such bonus scheme must be fair, reasonable, and clearly communicated to the employee.

2. **Long-term Incentive Plans (LTIPs)**: LTIPs such as stock options or RSUs are not specifically addressed in the Employment and Industrial Relations Act. Their legality would depend on the specific terms of the incentive plan and its compliance with other relevant laws, such as the Companies Act and financial regulations.

3. **Deferred Compensation**: Deferred compensation plans are not specifically prohibited by Maltese law, but they must be structured in a way that does not infringe upon the employee's right to timely payment of wages as per the Employment and Industrial Relations Act.

4. **Clawback Provisions**: Clawback provisions can be included in employment contracts; however, they must be reasonable and not constitute a penalty. They should be designed to recover bonuses or other variable compensation, not fixed wages, and must be clearly communicated and agreed upon by the employee.

5. **Non-compete and Non-solicitation Clauses**: Such clauses are subject to limitations under Maltese law. They must be reasonable in terms of duration, geographical scope, and the type of work restricted. If deemed excessive, they may be considered unenforceable.

6. **Tailored Training and Development**: Offering training and development is generally legal and encouraged, but it cannot be used as a tool to unduly bind an employee to the company. Any obligations tied to training (e.g., repayment if the employee leaves early) must be reasonable and proportionate.

It is important to note that all terms of employment contracts must comply with the Employment and Industrial Relations Act (CAP. 452), which sets out the rights and obligations of employers and employees. Any clauses that are deemed unfair or contrary to the mandatory provisions of the Act may be considered null and void.

For specific legal provisions and detailed assessments of the legality of employment contract terms, it would be necessary to consult the Employment and Industrial Relations Act (CAP. 452) and other relevant legislation, as well as potentially seek legal advice to ensure compliance with Maltese law.

Answer =>  Based on the information provided, it appears that Excel Homes Real Estate Limited has filed a sworn application against Martin Pace and Mary Pace, claiming a debt of €37,465.00 for services rendered as a real estate agency. The company asserts that this amount is due for commission and VAT related to a property transaction, and despite official correspondence, the defendants have remained in default.

The defendants have raised several preliminary exceptions, including that Mary Pace was not a legitimate contradictor and should be released from the judgment immediately, as she did not sign any contract with the plaintiff company and was cited in the lawsuit vexatiously. They also claim that the contract in question is null due to being flawed in fact and in law, alleging that Martin Pace was under pressure when he signed it. Furthermore, they argue that the contract contains unfair terms prohibited by law, imposes disproportionately high compensation for the alleged service, binds the consumer with clauses that were not clearly understood before signing, and is incompatible with the requirements of the law regarding pre-contractual negotiations and mutual consent.

In light of these arguments, the court must consider the evidence presented by both parties, including the sworn application, the contract, and any official correspondence. The court must also assess the validity of the contract and whether it contains unfair terms as alleged by the defendants. The court will need to determine if the defendants have valid exceptions that can be raised in this case.

The decision of the court will depend on the application of relevant laws, including the Code of Organization and Civil Procedure (Chapter 12 of the Laws of Malta), which governs the procedures for such cases, and the Consumer Affairs Act (Chapter 378 of the Laws of Malta), which deals with unfair contract terms and practices.

The court will have to decide whether to hear the case summarily without a full hearing (dispensing with the hearing) as requested by the plaintiff, or whether the defendants' exceptions merit a full hearing. If the court finds the contract to be null or containing unfair terms, it may dismiss the plaintiff's claims. Conversely, if the court finds the contract to be valid and the debt to be due, it may order the defendants to pay the claimed amount, along with any applicable interest and costs.

The court's decision will be based on the interpretation of the law and the facts presented, ensuring that justice is served in accordance with Maltese law.

Answer =>  Based on the information provided in the excerpts, I cannot provide a definitive decision on this case, as that would require careful consideration of all evidence and arguments by the court. However, I can explain the relevant legal provisions and outline the key issues the court will need to assess:

1. Validity of the Contract:
The defendants have raised several exceptions challenging the validity of the contract between Excel Homes Real Estate Limited and Martin Pace. The court will need to examine if the contract is null or voidable due to any of the following grounds alleged by the defendants:

a) Lack of consent/undue influence (Article 974 of Civil Code): The defendants claim Martin Pace was under pressure when signing the contract, which could vitiate his free consent.

b) Unfair contract terms (Consumer Affairs Act, Chapter 378, Articles 44-47): The defendants argue the contract contains unfair, prohibited clauses like disproportionately high compensation, binding the consumer to unclear terms, and incompatibility with pre-contractual negotiation requirements.

If the court finds the contract to be null or containing unfair terms, it may declare the contract invalid or unenforceable.

2. Liability of Mary Pace:
The defendants claim Mary Pace should be released from the judgment as she did not sign the contract. The court will need to determine if she can be held liable based on the evidence and her relationship to the transaction.

3. Entitlement to Commission:
If the court upholds the validity of the contract, it will need to assess if Excel Homes Real Estate Limited is entitled to the claimed commission and VAT based on the services rendered and the terms of the contract.

Sources:
- Civil Code (Chapter 16 of the Laws of Malta) - Articles related to validity of contracts
- Consumer Affairs Act (Chapter 378 of the Laws of Malta) - Articles 44-47 on unfair contract terms

The court's decision will depend on its evaluation of the evidence, arguments, and application of the relevant laws. If the necessary information is not available in the provided excerpts, I cannot speculate further without risking providing inaccurate or unsupported information.

Query =>  what is the most likely outcome 
Answer =>  Based on the information provided in the excerpts, it is difficult to predict the most likely outcome with certainty. However, I can analyze the key factors that the court will likely consider and provide an assessment of the potential outcomes:

1. Validity of the Contract:
The defendants have raised strong arguments challenging the validity of the contract, alleging lack of consent due to undue pressure on Martin Pace, and the presence of unfair terms prohibited by the Consumer Affairs Act. If the court finds merit in these arguments, it may declare the contract null and void or unenforceable, which would likely result in the dismissal of the plaintiff's claims.

2. Liability of Mary Pace:
The defendants have argued that Mary Pace should be released from the judgment as she did not sign the contract. Unless the plaintiff can provide evidence of her direct involvement or liability, the court may release her from the case.

3. Entitlement to Commission:
If the court upholds the validity of the contract, it will need to assess whether the plaintiff is entitled to the claimed commission and VAT based on the services rendered and the terms of the contract. The court may award the claimed amount or a portion thereof if it finds the plaintiff's claims to be valid and supported by evidence.

Considering the arguments presented by both parties, the potential outcomes could be:

a) The court finds the contract to be null or containing unfair terms, leading to the dismissal of the plaintiff's claims against both defendants.

b) The court releases Mary Pace from the case but finds the contract to be valid and enforceable against Martin Pace, ordering him to pay the claimed amount or a portion thereof.

c) The court upholds the validity of the contract and orders both defendants to pay the claimed amount or a portion thereof.

Based on the defendants' arguments and the provisions of the Consumer Affairs Act, the most likely outcome appears to be either (a) or (b), where the court may find issues with the validity of the contract or release Mary Pace from liability. However, the final decision will depend on the court's assessment of the evidence, arguments, and application of the relevant laws.

It is important to note that without access to the complete evidence and legal arguments, any prediction of the outcome remains speculative. The court's decision will be based on a thorough evaluation of all factors and adherence to the principles of Maltese law.

The company asserts that this amount is due for commission and VAT related to a property transaction, and despite official correspondence, the defendants have remained in default.<br /><br />The defendants have raised several preliminary exceptions, including that Mary Pace was not a legitimate contradictor and should be released from the judgment immediately, as she did not sign any contract with the plaintiff company and was cited in the lawsuit vexatiously. They also claim that the contract in question is null due to being flawed in fact and in law, alleging that Martin Pace was under pressure when he signed it. Furthermore, they argue that the contract contains unfair terms prohibited by law, imposes disproportionately high compensation for the alleged service, binds the consumer with clauses that were not clearly understood before signing, and is incompatible with the requirements of the law regarding pre-contractual negotiations and mutual consent.<br /><br />In light of these arguments, the court must consider the evidence presented by both parties, including the sworn application, the contract, and any official correspondence. The court must also assess the validity of the contract and whether it contains unfair terms as alleged by the defendants. The court will need to determine if the defendants have valid exceptions that can be raised in this case.<br /><br />The decision of the court will depend on the application of relevant laws, including the Code of Organization and Civil Procedure (Chapter 12 of the Laws of Malta), which governs the procedures for such cases, and the Consumer Affairs Act (Chapter 378 of the Laws of Malta), which deals with unfair contract terms and practices.<br /><br />The court will have to decide whether to hear the case summarily without a full hearing (dispensing with the hearing) as requested by the plaintiff, or whether the defendants' exceptions merit a full hearing. If the court finds the contract to be null or containing unfair terms, it may dismiss the plaintiff's claims. Conversely, if the court finds the contract to be valid and the debt to be due, it may order the defendants to pay the claimed amount, along with any applicable interest and costs.<br /><br />The court's decision will be based on the interpretation of the law and the facts presented, ensuring that justice is served in accordance with Maltese law.<br />
Answer =>  Based on the information provided in the excerpts, I cannot provide a definitive decision on this case, as that would require careful consideration of all evidence and arguments by the court. However, I can explain the relevant legal provisions and outline the key issues the court will need to assess:

1. Validity of the Contract:
The defendants have raised several exceptions challenging the validity of the contract between Excel Homes Real Estate Limited and Martin Pace. The court will need to examine if the contract is null or voidable due to any of the following grounds alleged by the defendants:

a) Lack of consent/undue influence (Article 974 of Civil Code): The defendants claim Martin Pace was under pressure when signing the contract, which could vitiate his free consent.

b) Unfair contract terms (Consumer Affairs Act, Chapter 378, Articles 44-47): The defendants argue the contract contains unfair, prohibited clauses like disproportionately high compensation, binding the consumer to unclear terms, and incompatibility with pre-contractual negotiation requirements.

If the court finds the contract to be null or containing unfair terms, it may declare the contract invalid or unenforceable.

2. Liability of Mary Pace:
The defendants claim Mary Pace should be released from the judgment as she did not sign the contract. The court will need to determine if she can be held liable based on the evidence and her relationship to the transaction.

3. Entitlement to Commission:
If the court upholds the validity of the contract, it will need to assess if Excel Homes Real Estate Limited is entitled to the claimed commission and VAT based on the services rendered and the terms of the contract.

The court's decision will depend on its evaluation of the evidence, arguments, and application of the relevant laws. If the necessary information is not available in the provided excerpts, I cannot speculate further without risking providing inaccurate or unsupported information.

Query =>  analyze The precautionary warrant of prohibitory injunction <br /><br />
Answer =>  The precautionary warrant of prohibitory injunction is a legal measure available under Maltese law that allows a person to restrain another from performing certain actions that could be prejudicial to the applicant's rights. This type of warrant is designed to preserve the rights of the person requesting it, ensuring that those rights are not infringed upon while a case is being decided.

According to Article 873 of the Code of Organization and Civil Procedure, the object of a warrant of prohibitory injunction is to "restrain a person from doing anything whatsoever which might be prejudicial to the person suing out the warrant." The court will not issue such a warrant unless it is satisfied that the warrant is necessary to preserve any right of the person suing out the warrant and that prima facie (on the face of it) the person appears to possess such right.

Furthermore, the court will not issue a warrant of prohibitory injunction against the Government or authority established by the Constitution or any person holding a public office in their official capacity unless the authority or person against whom the warrant is demanded confirms in open court that the thing sought to be restrained is in fact intended to be done. Additionally, the court must be satisfied that unless the warrant is issued, the prejudice that would be caused to the person suing out the warrant would be disproportionate when compared with the actual doing of the thing sought to be restrained.

In the event that a person restrained by a warrant of prohibitory injunction acts in breach of the court's order, the court may, at the request of the applicant, condemn the person against whom the warrant had been issued to penalties as established by law.

The process of applying for a warrant of prohibitory injunction involves the applicant confirming on oath their interest in securing their rights and detailing the acts they wish to restrain the respondent from performing. The application is then presented to the court, which, if it finds the application to be in order, will issue a court warrant to the Marshal of the Courts to restrain the respondent from carrying out the prejudicial actions.

It is important to note that the liability for the payment of a penalty arising under this article is without prejudice to any other possible sanction arising under the provisions of Title XVII of Book Third of the Code of Organization and Civil Procedure.

The relevant sections of the Code of Organization and Civil Procedure that discuss the warrant of prohibitory injunction are Articles 873 and 830, which outline the object of the warrant, the inquiry of the court, and the general provisions of precautionary acts.

Query =>  is there any law about whistleblowers in companies
Answer =>  Yes, there is a law in Malta that provides protection for whistleblowers within companies. The Protection of the Whistleblower Act (CAP. 527) outlines the framework for the protection of individuals who report improper practices, breaches of law, or risks to the public interest. According to this Act, a whistleblower is protected from detrimental action for making a protected disclosure. A protected disclosure is one where the whistleblower has reasonable grounds to believe that the information on breaches disclosed was true at the time of the disclosure and that such information fell within the scope of the Act. The whistleblower must disclose the information internally in accordance with Article 12, externally in accordance with Article 16, or make a public disclosure in accordance with Article 18A.

The Act also specifies that a whistleblower may not be subjected to any civil or criminal proceedings or to a disciplinary proceeding for having made such a disclosure. Moreover, if a whistleblower suffers a detriment as a result of making a public disclosure, it is presumed that the detriment was in retaliation for the report or disclosure, and the burden of proof lies with the person who took the detrimental action to show that it was based on duly justified grounds.

Furthermore, employers are required to establish internal procedures for whistleblowing, maintain communication with the whistleblower, and follow up diligently on the reports made. Clear and easily accessible information about these internal procedures and how to report externally must be published within the organization.

It is important to note that the protections conferred by the Act do not apply to an employee who knowingly discloses information that is false.

These provisions are designed to encourage the reporting of misconduct and to safeguard the interests of the whistleblower, the company, and the public.

Query =>  are there laws specifically to companies
Answer =>  I apologize, but I must clarify that my responses are limited to Maltese Company Law as per the Companies Act [CAP. 386], and I do not have information on the Protection of the Whistleblower Act [CAP. 527] within the provided documents. Therefore, I cannot confirm or provide details about whistleblower laws specifically within the context of Maltese Company Law.

However, within the Companies Act [CAP. 386], there are provisions that relate to the protection of shareholders and the governance of companies, which may indirectly relate to the principles of whistleblowing. For instance, Article 402 of the Companies Act provides protection for shareholders against unfair prejudice. It states that any member of a company who complains that the affairs of the company have been or are being conducted in a manner that is oppressive, unfairly discriminatory, or unfairly prejudicial to a member or members, or in a manner that is contrary to the interests of the company, may apply to the court for an order under this provision.

This article aims to protect shareholders from actions that may harm their interests or the interests of the company and could potentially provide a legal avenue for addressing grievances that might also be the subject of a whistleblower's report.

Please note that while this provision offers a form of protection for shareholders, it is not a whistleblower protection law per se. For specific whistleblower protections, one would need to refer to the relevant legislation, such as the Protection of the Whistleblower Act [CAP. 527], which is not included in the scope of the documents provided to me.

Query =>  according to maltese law can there be a capping on limitation of liability if a contract says so
Answer =>  Under Maltese law, the limitation of liability can indeed be subject to caps as specified in contracts, provided that such limitations are not prohibited by law. In the context of associations, for instance, a member's liability to third parties with whom the association has contracted can be varied by a contract with the third party, and such a contract will not bind other members without their consent. Additionally, a member's liability can be excluded or limited by any provision of law (Civil Code [CAP. 16], Article 578(b)).

In the realm of merchant shipping, the owner of a ship is generally responsible for obligations contracted by the master in relation to the ship and is liable for damages caused by acts or omissions in the navigation or management of the ship. However, there are exclusions to this liability, such as loss or damage due to fire on board the ship without the actual fault or privity of the owners, or loss or damage to certain valuable items that were not declared at the time of shipment (Merchant Shipping [CAP. 234], Articles 347 and 348).

It is important to note that some articles related to the limitation of liability in certain cases have been rendered not applicable as from 1st March, 2004 (Merchant Shipping [CAP. 234], Articles 349 to 356).

Therefore, while there can be contractual caps on liability, such caps must align with the provisions of the law, and any attempt to limit liability through contract must not contravene existing legal provisions.

Query =>  do consolidated laws contain legal notices?
Answer =>  Yes, consolidated laws may contain legal notices. The process of consolidation involves integrating all amendments made to a law, including those promulgated as legal notices, into a single document. This ensures that the law is presented in a comprehensive and updated form. The Minister responsible for justice is empowered to publish on an internet site a consolidated version of any revised edition of the laws, which includes all amendments made to any law in a revised edition, as well as all Acts enacted after the publication of the last revised edition, incorporating all amendments to them. This includes subsidiary legislation made under the laws included in a revised edition and under Acts subsequently enacted, which may also be published in a consolidated form on the internet site (Publication of laws on the internet, Article 12(1) and (2)).

Furthermore, the Minister is required to publish a notice in the Gazette providing the address of the website where the laws are published, ensuring public accessibility to the consolidated laws (Publication of laws on the internet, Article 12(3)).

Query =>  University Campus - Clamping And Removal Of Encumbering Objects
Answer =>  In accordance with Maltese Company Law, the provisions for the clamping and removal of encumbering objects, such as vehicles causing a nuisance, inconvenience, or obstruction in public places, are clearly outlined. The law grants the authority to remove, store, or dispose of vehicles found in contravention of any law or regulation, or those causing obstructions in public thoroughfares. This includes the power to clamp vehicles and prescribe fees for removal, storage, and clamping.

Specifically, the law states that regulations may be made for the removal, storage, or disposal, or the clamping of any vehicle found on any road in contravention of any law or regulation made thereunder, or of any vehicle, seacraft, or other thing causing a nuisance, inconvenience, or obstruction in any street, road, quay, wharf, or other public place. It also allows for the establishment of fees payable for the removal of clamps, towing, storage of objects, and for the auction or other form of disposal of such objects.

Furthermore, the law provides for the disposal of objects without liability when they are not claimed by their owners within a prescribed time. The authority is also excluded from any liability, other than liability for gross negligence, incurred in connection with the execution of its duties under the said regulations.

In the context of a university campus, these provisions would apply to the clamping and removal of vehicles or other encumbering objects that obstruct common areas or thoroughfares. The responsible authority, such as the Housing Authority or the Planning Authority, would have the right to enforce these regulations, ensuring that the rights of third parties or the Authority are not molested by such obstructions.

It is important to note that these actions are taken in addition to other laws and do not derogate from the rights of the government to deal with land or property in accordance with other provisions, such as the Land Acquisition (Public Purposes) Ordinance.

Query =>  in which areas can vehicles be clamped
Answer =>  Vehicles can be clamped in various areas as per the regulations set forth in Maltese law. These areas include:

1. Any road, street, or place of public thoroughfare where a vehicle is found in contravention of any law or regulation, such as parking violations or causing obstructions.
2. Public places such as quays, wharfs, and other similar areas where a vehicle is causing a nuisance, inconvenience, or obstruction.
3. Areas where a vehicle's license or tax has not been paid, or where fines due for offenses committed through the use of the vehicle have not been duly paid.
4. Restricted areas where specific authorization is required to enter or drive a motor vehicle, and such authorization has not been granted or conditions of the security pass or authorization are not complied with.

It is important to note that vehicles displaying a Blue Badge, which is a parking card for people with disabilities, shall be exempt from clamping or towing, although any related fines may be increased by one degree if applicable.

The authority responsible for enforcing these regulations has the power to prescribe the fees for the removal, storage, and clamping of vehicles, and to establish the circumstances under which these actions can be taken.

Query =>  company a is owed 10,000 euro. the court decided in it's favor. can it sequester tools from the debtor if these are used in the day to day business?
Answer =>  In the context of Maltese Company Law, when a company is owed a debt and the court has decided in its favor, the company (creditor) may request the issuance of a warrant of seizure against the debtor's property. However, there are specific provisions regarding the seizure of tools used in the day-to-day business of the debtor.

According to Article 848A of the Code of Organization and Civil Procedure, a precautionary warrant of seizure of a commercial going concern may be issued to secure a debt or claims which could be frustrated by the sale in part or in whole of the said going concern. This means that if the tools in question are part of a commercial going concern, the court may issue a warrant to preserve the totality of the assets of the going concern, including tools and equipment necessary for the business to operate.

The court will only issue such a warrant if it is satisfied that it is necessary to protect the rights of the applicant (creditor) and that there are no other means to safeguard the amount due. Additionally, the court must be convinced that the creditor has prima facie rights that need protection.

Furthermore, Article 848B stipulates that when a demand is made for the issue of this warrant, the court shall appoint an administrator to oversee the process. The court may decide to allow the going concern to continue being run by the debtor or by persons entrusted by the debtor with the assistance of the administrator, or it may appoint an administrator who is qualified to run and manage the going concern.

Therefore, if the tools are essential for the day-to-day business of the debtor and are part of a commercial going concern, the creditor may not be able to sequester them without the court considering the impact on the business and appointing an administrator to manage the situation appropriately.

Query =>  if there are 4 people living in a household, how many marijuana plants can they grow?
Answer =>  According to Maltese Company Law, regardless of the number of residents within a household, the cultivation of cannabis for personal use is limited to a maximum of four plants. This means that if there are four people living in a household, they can collectively grow up to four marijuana plants. It is important to note that the cultivation should not occur in a space visible to the public. Additionally, the possession of dried cannabis for personal use should not exceed fifty grams. If the dried cannabis found on the premises exceeds fifty grams, it may be seized by the Executive Police. Please note that this information is based on the provisions outlined in the law and should not be considered as legal advice. (Sources: LXVI.2021.31, Cap. 291)

Query =>  can the police stop you while carrying marijuana<br /><br />
Answer =>  In Malta, the police have the authority to stop individuals suspected of carrying marijuana. However, the law specifies certain conditions regarding the possession of cannabis for personal use. According to Maltese law, the possession by a person over the age of eighteen (18) years of the drug cannabis in an amount not exceeding seven grams, in circumstances in which it may be reasonably deemed that such possession is for the personal use of such person, shall not constitute an offence, and that person shall not be subject to being taken into custody under arrest unless there is a reasonable suspicion of trafficking or dealing in the drug cannabis.

Furthermore, the cultivation of up to four plants of the drug cannabis, and the possession of not more than fifty grams of dried cannabis, for personal use by a person over the age of eighteen (18) years, within the residential address appearing on an official document showing his place of residence, shall not constitute an offence, and that person shall not be subject to being taken into custody under arrest only by reason of such cultivation and possession at the said address.

However, if the police find an individual in possession of more than seven grams of cannabis in public or more than fifty grams at their residential address, the cannabis will be seized. In such cases, the police have the power to take action, which may include stopping the individual and seizing the cannabis.

It is important to note that these provisions do not authorize the consumption of cannabis in public or in the presence of persons under the age of eighteen (18) years, and doing so can result in penalties.

Query =>  what happens if someone is caught with 8 grams?
Answer =>  If someone in Malta is caught with 8 grams of cannabis, which is slightly above the threshold for personal use as defined by Maltese law, the police have the authority to seize the cannabis. The individual may be subject to legal proceedings since the possession exceeds the 7-gram limit for personal use.

According to the law, where a charge for breach of the drug laws consists of a charge of possession of the drug cannabis in a quantity of more than seven grams but not more than twenty-eight grams, in circumstances which do not give rise to reasonable grounds to believe that the prohibited drug is not for personal use by the person in possession thereof, that person shall be tried in accordance with the Commissioners for Justice Act. Upon conviction by the Commissioner for Justice assigned by the Minister to hear drug offence cases, the individual shall be liable to a penalty of between fifty euro (€50) and one hundred euro (€100).

Therefore, being caught with 8 grams of cannabis could lead to a fine as stipulated above, assuming that there are no reasonable grounds to suspect that the cannabis is not for personal use.

Query =>  what if the quantity is more than 28 grams
Answer =>  If the quantity of cannabis found in possession of an individual in Malta is more than 28 grams, this exceeds the threshold for what is considered to be for personal use under Maltese law. In such cases, the individual is likely to face more serious legal consequences.

According to Maltese law, possession of cannabis in a quantity of more than 28 grams gives rise to a presumption that the cannabis is not intended for personal use. This means that the individual may be subject to criminal proceedings and could potentially be charged with drug trafficking, which is a much more serious offence than simple possession.

The law states that where the possession of the drug cannabis is in a quantity which exceeds that which may be reasonably deemed to be for personal use, the person in possession thereof shall be liable, upon conviction, to the punishment of imprisonment for a term from six months to ten years, and to a fine (multa) of not less than two thousand and three hundred and twenty-nine euro and thirty-seven cents (€2,329.37) and not more than eleven thousand and six hundred and forty-six euro and eighty-seven cents (€11,646.87).

Therefore, being found in possession of more than 28 grams of cannabis is a serious matter and can lead to significant legal penalties, including imprisonment and a substantial fine.

Query =>  is a jail term mandatory if guilty
Answer =>  In Maltese law, a jail term is not always mandatory when a person is found guilty of an offence. The imposition of a jail sentence depends on the nature of the offence, the circumstances surrounding it, and the discretion of the court. There are provisions within the law that allow for alternative sentences or measures, such as fines, suspended sentences, probation, or community service, depending on the specific case and the applicable legal provisions.

For instance, the Criminal Code provides that the court may award a lesser punishment when the jury is not unanimous in certain cases. Additionally, the court may impose a punishment of imprisonment for a term from twelve to forty years instead of life imprisonment if the accused declares himself guilty before the constitution of the jury for a crime that would otherwise be punishable by life imprisonment.

Moreover, the court may also consider the possibility of suspending a sentence of imprisonment in accordance with the provisions of article 28A, which allows for the suspension of sentences under certain conditions.

It is important to note that the specific circumstances of each case, the nature of the offence, and the applicable legal provisions will determine whether a jail term is mandatory or if alternative sentences can be applied.

Answer =>  In the context of Maltese law, when an individual is found in possession of more than 28 grams of cannabis, it is presumed that the cannabis is not for personal use, and the individual may face criminal proceedings for drug trafficking. However, a jail term is not automatically mandatory. The court has discretion in sentencing, taking into account various factors such as the circumstances of the case and the individual's criminal history.

The law does provide for the possibility of imprisonment for such an offence, stating that the person in possession thereof shall be liable, upon conviction, to the punishment of imprisonment for a term from six months to ten years, and to a fine (multa) of not less than two thousand and three hundred and twenty-nine euro and thirty-seven cents (€2,329.37) and not more than eleven thousand and six hundred and forty-six euro and eighty-seven cents (€11,646.87). However, the actual sentence imposed is subject to the court's judgment.

Therefore, while the law stipulates that imprisonment is a potential consequence for possession of cannabis in a quantity exceeding the threshold for personal use, whether a jail term is mandatory will depend on the court's decision in each individual case.

Query =>  what happens if someone is caught with 8 grams?
Answer =>  If someone in Malta is caught with 8 grams of cannabis, which is slightly above the threshold for personal use as defined by Maltese law, the police have the authority to seize the cannabis. The individual may be subject to legal proceedings since the possession exceeds the 7-gram limit for personal use.

According to the law, where a charge for breach of the drug laws consists of a charge of possession of the drug cannabis in a quantity of more than seven grams but not more than twenty-eight grams, in circumstances which do not give rise to reasonable grounds to believe that the prohibited drug is not for personal use by the person in possession thereof, that person shall be tried in accordance with the Commissioners for Justice Act. Upon conviction by the Commissioner for Justice assigned by the Minister to hear drug offence cases, the individual shall be liable to a penalty of between fifty euro (€50) and one hundred euro (€100).

Therefore, being caught with 8 grams of cannabis could lead to a fine as stipulated above, assuming that there are no reasonable grounds to suspect that the cannabis is not for personal use.

Query =>  which drug offences attract a mandatory jail term
Answer =>  In Maltese law, certain drug offences do attract a mandatory jail term. Specifically, the law provides for mandatory imprisonment for certain serious drug offences, particularly those involving trafficking, selling, or dealing in drugs, especially those listed under Part A of the Third Schedule to the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance.

For example, the law states that where the offence consists in selling or dealing in a drug listed under Part A of the Third Schedule to this Ordinance contrary to the provisions of this article, or in an offence under sub-article (1)(f), or of the offence of possession of a drug, contrary to the provisions of this Ordinance, under such circumstances that the court is satisfied that such possession was not for the exclusive use of the offender, the person convicted shall be liable to imprisonment for a term of not less than six months but not exceeding ten years and to a fine (multa) of not less than four hundred and sixty-five euro and eighty-seven cents (465.87) but not exceeding eleven thousand and six hundred and forty-six euro and eighty-seven cents (11,646.87).

Furthermore, if the court is satisfied that the possession was not for the exclusive use of the offender, or if the offences mentioned in sub-articles (1C) or (1D) or (1E) are committed, the punishment can be imprisonment for life, although the court may impose a lesser sentence of imprisonment for a term of not less than four years but not exceeding thirty years and a fine (multa) if certain conditions are met, such as the age of the offender, the previous conduct of the offender, the quantity of the drug, and other circumstances of the offence.

It is important to note that while mandatory jail terms are prescribed for certain offences, the court still has discretion in sentencing based on the specific facts and circumstances of each case.

Answer =>  In the context of Maltese law, when an individual is found in possession of more than 28 grams of cannabis, it is presumed that the cannabis is not for personal use, and the individual may face criminal proceedings for drug trafficking. However, a jail term is not automatically mandatory. The court has discretion in sentencing, taking into account various factors such as the circumstances of the case and the individual's criminal history.

The law does provide for the possibility of imprisonment for such an offence, stating that the person in possession thereof shall be liable, upon conviction, to the punishment of imprisonment for a term from six months to ten years, and to a fine (multa) of not less than two thousand and three hundred and twenty-nine euro and thirty-seven cents (€2,329.37) and not more than eleven thousand and six hundred and forty-six euro and eighty-seven cents (€11,646.87). However, the actual sentence imposed is subject to the court's judgment.

Therefore, while the law stipulates that imprisonment is a potential consequence for possession of cannabis in a quantity exceeding the threshold for personal use, whether a jail term is mandatory will depend on the court's decision in each individual case.

Query =>  is a jail term mandatory if guilty
Answer =>  In Maltese law, a jail term is not always mandatory when a person is found guilty of an offence. The imposition of a jail sentence depends on the nature of the offence, the circumstances surrounding it, and the discretion of the court. There are provisions within the law that allow for alternative sentences or measures, such as fines, suspended sentences, probation, or community service, depending on the specific case and the applicable legal provisions.

For instance, the Criminal Code provides that the court may award a lesser punishment when the jury is not unanimous in certain cases. Additionally, the court may impose a punishment of imprisonment for a term from twelve to forty years instead of life imprisonment if the accused declares himself guilty before the constitution of the jury for a crime that would otherwise be punishable by life imprisonment.

Moreover, the court may also consider the possibility of suspending a sentence of imprisonment in accordance with the provisions of article 28A, which allows for the suspension of sentences under certain conditions.

It is important to note that the specific circumstances of each case, the nature of the offence, and the applicable legal provisions will determine whether a jail term is mandatory or if alternative sentences can be applied.

Query =>  what if the quantity is more than 28 grams
Answer =>  If the quantity of cannabis found in possession of an individual in Malta is more than 28 grams, this exceeds the threshold for what is considered to be for personal use under Maltese law. In such cases, the individual is likely to face more serious legal consequences.

According to Maltese law, possession of cannabis in a quantity of more than 28 grams gives rise to a presumption that the cannabis is not intended for personal use. This means that the individual may be subject to criminal proceedings and could potentially be charged with drug trafficking, which is a much more serious offence than simple possession.

The law states that where the possession of the drug cannabis is in a quantity which exceeds that which may be reasonably deemed to be for personal use, the person in possession thereof shall be liable, upon conviction, to the punishment of imprisonment for a term from six months to ten years, and to a fine (multa) of not less than two thousand and three hundred and twenty-nine euro and thirty-seven cents (€2,329.37) and not more than eleven thousand and six hundred and forty-six euro and eighty-seven cents (€11,646.87).

Therefore, being found in possession of more than 28 grams of cannabis is a serious matter and can lead to significant legal penalties, including imprisonment and a substantial fine.

Answer =>  In Maltese law, there are indeed mandatory jail terms for serious drug offences, particularly those related to trafficking, selling, or dealing in drugs, as well as possession under certain conditions. The Dangerous Drugs Ordinance outlines these mandatory penalties.

When someone is convicted of selling or dealing in drugs that are listed under Part A of the Third Schedule to the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, or if they are found guilty of possession of such drugs under circumstances that indicate the drugs were not solely for their personal use, the law mandates a minimum imprisonment term. Specifically, the convicted person is subject to imprisonment for at least six months but not more than ten years. Additionally, they must pay a fine (multa) that is no less than four hundred and sixty-five euro and eighty-seven cents (465.87) but does not exceed eleven thousand and six hundred and forty-six euro and eighty-seven cents (11,646.87).

Moreover, if the court is convinced that the possession of drugs was not for the individual's exclusive use, or if the individual committed offences mentioned in sub-articles (1C), (1D), or (1E), the law provides for a potential life sentence. However, the court has the discretion to impose a lesser sentence if it deems life imprisonment inappropriate. This lesser sentence would be imprisonment for a term of not less than four years and not more than thirty years, along with a fine (multa) ranging from two thousand and three hundred and twenty-nine euro and thirty-seven cents (2,329.37) to one hundred and sixteen thousand and four hundred and sixty-eight euro and sixty-seven cents (116,468.67). The court takes into account various factors such as the offender's age, past behavior, the quantity of drugs involved, and any other relevant circumstances of the offence before deciding on the appropriate sentence.

It's important to understand that while the law prescribes mandatory jail terms for certain drug offences, the court retains the ability to adjust the sentence based on the unique details of each case. This means that the court can consider the specific facts and circumstances surrounding the offence and the offender before determining the final sentence.

The information provided is based on the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as outlined in the provided context.

Query =>  what topics does this edition cover
Answer =>  This edition of Awake! magazine from Jehovah's Witnesses covers the following main topics:

1. Threats to Our Safety and Security - It discusses various challenges facing humanity like cybercrime, financial inequality, conflict and persecution, and threats to the environment. 

2. Getting to the Root of Our Problems - It examines how efforts to address problems often only treat symptoms rather than underlying causes, and how education is needed to change attitudes and behaviors.

3. Moral Education - It discusses how even well-educated people can make bad moral decisions and how the Bible provides moral and spiritual guidance. 

4. How the Challenge Will Be Fully Overcome - It explains how the establishment of God's Kingdom on earth will bring global peace and security under Jesus Christ's rulership according to Bible prophecy. 

5. Peace Will Abound - It discusses prophecies about the Kingdom, how it will take power, and the benefits people will receive when it rules over all the earth.

6. Will We Ever Feel Safe and Secure? - It considers whether humanity alone can solve problems and bring lasting peace, or if we need divine intervention from God and his Kingdom.

So in summary, it addresses the question of whether mankind can solve its problems and bring true security, or if we need God's Kingdom to fully meet the challenge according to the teachings of Jehovah's Witnesses.

Query =>  what is in this issue
Answer =>  As a JW bot focused on "Awake!" magazine, I'm happy to discuss the themes and content of the March/April 2019 issue with you. This particular issue explores some major challenges facing mankind and whether we have the ability to solve them on our own.

The main themes covered include:

1. Threats to Our Safety and Security
The opening article highlights major problems like cybercrime, financial inequality, conflict/persecution, and environmental degradation that undermine peace and security worldwide. It questions if mankind has the resources to truly address the root causes.

2. Getting to the Root of Our Problems  
This article argues that simply treating the symptoms of issues like crime, addiction, etc. is not enough. It emphasizes the need to correct the underlying attitudes, desires and moral failings that drive these problems.

3. The Power of Love
Here the magazine explores how cultivating unselfish love can transform human behavior and relationships in a positive way. It provides examples of how parental love shapes children.

4. Why Education Alone Is Not Enough
While education is valuable, this article explains why knowledge and facts alone cannot solve issues rooted in human imperfection and selfish tendencies.

5. A Unique Education for a Better Future
The final article introduces the moral education provided through the Bible and how applying its wisdom can change attitudes and lead to a real solution to mankind's troubles.

I'd be happy to expand on any of those themes, share relevant scriptures, discuss moral lessons, or explore other parts of the issue that interest you. The goal is to facilitate an insightful dialogue on these important topics.

Query =>  tell me more about threats to society article
Answer =>  Certainly, I'd be happy to provide more details on the "Threats to Our Safety and Security" article from the March/April 2019 issue of Awake! magazine. This opening article highlights several major challenges that are undermining peace and security around the world:

Cybercrime: The article cites how the internet has become a "haven" for criminal activities like identity theft, online harassment, hacking, and exploitation of children. It warns that the internet enables some of humanity's worst vicious and cruel traits.

Financial Inequality: Drawing from an Oxfam report, it points out that just 8 of the world's richest people own as much wealth as the poorer half of the global population. This extreme inequality is funneling resources to a rich elite at the expense of the poor, especially women. There are fears it could trigger social unrest.

Conflict and Persecution: According to UN data cited, a record 68 million people have been forcibly displaced from their homes, largely due to conflict and persecution. On average, one person is displaced every two seconds.

Environmental Threats: The article highlights the mass extinction of biodiversity, severe air and water pollution, plummeting insect populations that could lead to an "ecological Armageddon", and the die-off of coral reefs around the world.

The article questions whether mankind truly has the resources and ability to effectively address the root causes behind these escalating threats to our safety, security and future survival on earth. It sets the stage for the remaining articles to explore potential solutions.

Let me know if you'd like me to expand on any part of this concerning overview of the major challenges we face as a global society. I can also provide relevant Bible principles that offer insight into the root causes.

Query =>  what license types does the mga offer<br /><br />
Answer =>  According to the Gaming Authorisations Regulations [S.L.583.05], the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) has the power to issue the following categories of licenses:

"The Authority shall have the power to issue licences of the categories set forth in the First Schedule:

Provided that where Government policy requires that certain gaming services may only be provided when in possession of a Government concession, the Authority shall not issue a licence for the carrying out of such gaming service unless the applicant is in possession of such concession."

The First Schedule of the regulations defines the following license categories:

Part A - Type 1 gaming services
Part B - Type 2 gaming services 
Part C - Type 3 gaming services
Part D - Type 4 gaming services

The regulations further define these types as follows:

"Type 1 gaming services" means the games defined as such in the First Schedule to the Gaming Authorisations Regulations;

"Type 2 gaming services" means games provided under a former Class 2 remote gaming license during the transitional period, and after that the games defined as such in the First Schedule; 

"Type 3 gaming services" means games provided under a former Class 3 remote gaming license during the transition, and after that the games defined as such in the First Schedule;

"Type 4 gaming services" means games provided under a former controlled skill games license during the transition, and after that the games defined as such in the First Schedule.

So in summary, the MGA offers four main categories of gaming service licenses, with the specific games covered by each category defined in the First Schedule to the Gaming Authorisations Regulations.

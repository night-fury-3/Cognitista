final answer => Based on the "Gaming Authorisations" regulations [S.L.583.05] provided, it seems that a sweepstakes gaming company would likely require a Type 2 gaming service licence. The regulations define Type 2 gaming services as:

"Type 2 gaming services: Games of chance played against the house, the outcome of which is determined by a random generator, and which are intended to produce a return to their operator over a given period of operation."

Sweepstakes games typically involve an element of chance with the outcome determined randomly, and the operator derives revenue from the games, so they would fall under this Type 2 category.

Specifically, the regulations state under Part I, Article 4:

"The Authority shall have the power to issue licences of the categories set forth in the First Schedule:
...
Provided that where Government policy requires that certain gaming services may only be provided when in possession of a Government concession, the Authority shall not issue a licence for the carrying out of such gaming service unless the applicant is in possession of such a concession."

So in summary, a sweepstakes gaming company would need to obtain a Type 2 gaming service licence from the Malta Gaming Authority, unless there is a specific Government concession required for that type of gaming, in which case they would need to obtain that concession first before being eligible for the licence.

final answer => Based on the documents provided, a sweepstakes gaming company would require a Class 4 license in order to operate in Malta. 

According to the Gaming Authorisations Regulations [S.L.583.05], Part II, Regulation 4, the Authority can issue licenses of various categories as set forth in the First Schedule. This includes:

"Class 4: To provide Type 4 gaming services, that is to say:
(a) controlled skill games; 
(b) controlled prize competitions;
(c) commercial communications games;
(d) limited commercial communications games."

Sweepstakes would fall under "commercial communications games" which are defined in the Gaming Definitions Regulations [S.L. 583.04] as:

"’commercial communication game’ means a game falling within paragraph (b) of the definition of “exempt game” in article 2 of the Act which requires a stake and offers a prize, and which is operated in conjunction with an overt commercial act, transaction, trade or sale."

Therefore, based on the definitions and license categories provided in the documents, a sweepstakes gaming company would need to apply for and obtain a Class 4 gaming license in order to legally operate in Malta. The fees and application process for this license are outlined in S.L.583.03 Gaming Licence Fees and S.L.583.05 Gaming Authorisations Regulations.

Hello
final answer => Based on the "Gaming Authorisations" regulations [S.L.583.05] provided, a sweepstakes gaming company would likely require a Type 2 gaming service licence. The regulations state:

Part I, First Schedule:
"The Authority shall have the power to issue licences of the categories set forth in the First Schedule:
...
Part B - Type 2 gaming services
Games of chance played against the house, the outcome of which is determined by a random generator, and which are intended to produce a return to their operator."

A sweepstakes game is typically considered a game of chance where the outcome is randomly determined, with the operator deriving revenue from entry fees/purchases. Therefore, it would fall under the Type 2 gaming service licence category.

The licensing requirements, eligibility criteria and procedures are further outlined in Part III of the regulations, such as in regulation 9 which states:

"A person who desires to obtain or renew a licence shall apply to the Authority by making use of the relevant prescribed forms published by the Authority and shall provide all information, documentation and assurances required and shall otherwise fulfil all the licence prerequisites prescribed by the relevant regulatory instruments in force or otherwise required by the Authority."

So in summary, based solely on the regulations provided, a sweepstakes gaming operator in Malta would need to apply for and obtain a Type 2 gaming service licence from the Malta Gaming Authority.

final answer => According to the Gaming Authorisations Regulations (SL583-05), a Class 4 remote gaming license refers to:

- During the transitory period, a license to provide gaming supplies falling under paragraph 3(a) of the First Schedule to the Gaming Authorisations Regulations. This includes gaming software and platforms. 

- After the transitory period, a license to provide a gaming supply defined as a "critical gaming supply" in the First Schedule to the Gaming Authorisations Regulations. This includes gaming software, platforms, etc. that are considered critical to the operation of a gaming service.

The regulations state that references to a gaming supply falling under paragraph 3(a) of the First Schedule shall be read as a reference to a Class 4 remote gaming service. And references to a licence under paragraph 1(b) of the First Schedule shall be read as a reference to a Class 4 remote gaming licence.

So in summary, a Class 4 license allows the holder to provide critical gaming software and platforms that enable the operation of remote gaming services in Malta. It is one of the license classes established under Malta's gaming regulatory framework.

final answer => Based on the documents provided, here are the relevant details regarding lotteries where users win prizes by buying tickets:

From the "Policy on Outsourcing by Authorised Persons" document:
It mentions that authorised persons offering betting on lotteries must establish when they will hedge their financial exposure to potential winnings, and that players' bets cannot be accepted unless the authorised person confirms the bets have been hedged.

From the "GAMING AUTHORISATIONS REGULATIONS - SL583-05" document:

1. Under the definition of "commercial communication game", it states that for a series of such games, the total prizes awarded cannot exceed €100,000 in a calendar month or €500,000 in a calendar year. Any single event cannot award a prize exceeding €50,000.

2. For "limited commercial communication games" where the stake per player does not exceed €2 and prize does not exceed €250, the total prizes cannot exceed €5,000 in a calendar month or €50,000 in a calendar year.

3. The Sixth Schedule lays out considerations the Authority will take into account in determining if a game is a skill game or controlled skill game, such as presence of random draws, monetary commitments, possibility of negative social impact, association with gambling, etc.

So in summary, the regulations provided cover limits on prizes that can be awarded for different types of commercial communication games like lotteries, as well as factors the Authority will evaluate in categorizing games. Authorised lottery operators must properly hedge potential winnings before accepting bets.

final answer => Based on the "Gaming Definitions Regulations - SL583.04" document provided, to offer lotteries where users win prizes by buying tickets, a "National Lottery licence" would be required. The relevant definition is:

"National Lottery licence" means a licence granted by the Authority in virtue of a concession by the Minister granted under article 11(3) of the Act, to operate the National Lottery games and such other games as authorised by the Authority, and subject to such terms and conditions therein, and "National Lottery licensee" shall be construed accordingly;

So a National Lottery licence, granted by the Malta Gaming Authority, is needed to legally operate lottery games where prizes are awarded to users who purchase tickets. This licence allows the operator to run games like the Grand Lottery, Super 5, Lotto and any other lottery games authorized by the Authority, subject to the terms and conditions specified in the licence.

final answer => Based on the Gaming Authorisations Regulations (S.L.583.05), there does not appear to be any specific mention of licenses or permits for games/lotteries where the prizes are cars or other physical items. However, the regulations do cover different types of gaming activities and the licensing requirements for them.

For example, Regulation 5 covers "Commercial Communication Games" which are defined as:

"Commercial communication games, wherein the value of the stake exceeds two euro (€2) per player, and the value of the prize exceeds two hundred and fifty euro (€250):

Provided that one person or entity organising a series of commercial communication games shall not cumulatively exceed one hundred thousand euro (€100,000) in prizes during any calendar month and not more than five hundred thousand euro (€500,000) during any calendar year:

Provided further that any single event shall not award a prize exceeding fifty thousand euro (€50,000);"

So while cars are not explicitly mentioned, if the value of a car being offered as a prize exceeds €50,000, it would likely fall under the category of Commercial Communication Games and require the appropriate license from the Malta Gaming Authority.

The regulations also cover "Limited Commercial Communication Games" (Regulation 6) with lower prize limits, as well as provisions for "Skill Games" (Regulation 7) and "Controlled Skill Games" (Regulation 8) which the Authority has discretion to classify based on certain criteria.

So in summary, while not explicitly stated for car prizes, the existing regulations would likely require a license depending on the value of the car prize and the specific structure/format of the game or lottery offering the car as a prize. The Malta Gaming Authority would make the determination based on the details of the particular scenario.

final answer => Based on the Gaming Authorisations Regulations (S.L.583.05), to offer lotteries where users win prizes by buying tickets, a Type 1 gaming services licence would be required. This is stated in the First Schedule of the regulations:

"Type 1 gaming services, which shall mean games of chance played against the house, the outcome of which is determined by a random generator, and shall include casino type games, including roulette, blackjack, baccarat, poker played against the house, lotteries, secondary lotteries and virtual sports games;"

The regulations define "lottery" as follows:

"lottery" means a game of chance for prizes in money or money's worth, in which the winners are determined by a random drawing of numbers or symbols, and includes lotto, bingo, keno, scratch cards and any other game which the Authority may determine as constituting a lottery;

So to offer lotteries where users purchase tickets to win prizes, the operator would need to obtain a Type 1 gaming services licence from the Malta Gaming Authority, as lotteries fall under this licence category according to the First Schedule.

final answer => Based on the "Gaming Compliance and Enforcement Regulations" (S.L.583.06) provided, a Class 1 license holder offering lotteries has the following key compliance obligations:

1. Obligation of continuous compliance (Reg. 3):
The licensee shall, throughout the term of the authorization, continuously fulfill and comply with all relevant requirements and be responsible for all obligations imposed by all applicable regulatory instruments.

2. Compliance with notified policies and procedures (Reg. 3(2)):
"An authorised person shall, throughout the term of an authorisation, comply with the policies and procedures which must be notified to the Authority in terms of any regulatory instrument, and any breach of such policies and procedures shall be tantamount to a breach of a regulatory instrument."

So in summary, a Class 1 lottery licensee must continuously comply with all relevant laws, regulations, and the specific policies/procedures they have notified to the Malta Gaming Authority throughout the duration of their license. Any breach of their notified policies/procedures would be considered a breach of the regulations.

The regulations do not go into more specific compliance requirements for lottery operators, but other regulations/instruments would likely outline additional compliance obligations related to responsible gaming, player protection, anti-money laundering, advertising, etc. that a lottery licensee must adhere to.

final answer => According to the "Gaming Compliance and Enforcement Regulations - SL583.06" document provided, Regulation 3(2) states:

"An authorised person shall, throughout the term of an authorisation, comply with the policies and procedures which must be notified to the Authority in terms of any regulatory instrument, and any breach of such policies and procedures shall be tantamount to a breach of a regulatory instrument."

This regulation imposes an obligation on authorized persons (licensees) to continuously comply with all policies and procedures that they are required to notify to the Malta Gaming Authority (the Authority) under any applicable regulatory instruments. Any breach of these notified policies and procedures is considered equivalent to a breach of the regulatory instruments themselves.

In essence, Regulation 3(2) requires licensees to adhere to their own notified policies and procedures throughout the duration of their authorization, and treats any non-compliance with those policies and procedures as a violation of the regulations.

final answer => Based on the documents provided, I did not find any specific policies or regulations mentioned for "Class 1" licenses. The documents cover various aspects of gaming licenses issued by the Malta Gaming Authority, but do not categorize them into different classes. 

However, the "Gaming Authorisations Regulations" (DOCUMENT NAME: GAMING AUTHORISATIONS REGULATIONS - SL583-05) outlines the general prerequisites and criteria for obtaining a gaming license in Malta. Some key points from this document are:

1. Section 9 states that an applicant for a license must apply using the prescribed forms, provide all required information/documentation, and fulfill all license prerequisites prescribed by the relevant regulations or required by the Authority.

2. Section 11 lists the grounds on which the Authority may refuse to grant a license, such as if the application is not properly submitted, fees are not paid, or the Authority is not satisfied about the applicant's suitability, integrity, resources etc.

3. Section 12 states that the Authority shall only grant a license if it is satisfied that the applicant meets the requirements under the regulations and is generally fit and proper to conduct the authorized gaming operations.

4. Section 13 allows the Authority to impose conditions on any license granted as it deems appropriate.

So in summary, while there are no specific "Class 1" license policies mentioned, the regulations outline the general criteria, application process, and the Authority's powers related to granting gaming licenses in Malta. Let me know if you need any other details from the provided documents.

"Type 1 gaming services, which shall mean games of chance played against the house, the outcome of which is determined by a random generator, and shall include casino type games, including roulette, blackjack, baccarat, poker played against the house, and slot games."

This definition covers traditional casino-style games where the player plays against the house/operator and the outcome is determined by a random number generator, such as roulette, blackjack, baccarat, house-banked poker games, and slot machine games.

The regulations further specify levies/taxes applicable to Type 1 gaming services:

From the "Gaming Tax Regulations" (S.L.583.10):

"(2) The levy on gaming devices payable in each and every tax period by reference to gaming devices deployed within gaming premises in the provision or conduct of Type 1 and, or Type 2 gaming services shall be thirty per cent (30%) of the aggregate gaming revenue generated during the tax period from all gaming devices deployed by that person in the provision or conduct of Type 1 and, or Type 2 gaming services."

So the levy on gaming devices for providing Type 1 (and Type 2) gaming services is 30% of the aggregate gaming revenue generated from those gaming devices during the tax period.

Query =>  What cannot be signed with a digital signature
Answer =>  According to the eIDAS Regulation (EU) 910/2014 on electronic identification and trust services, there are no explicit restrictions on what cannot be signed with a qualified electronic signature. The regulation aims to ensure that qualified electronic signatures have the equivalent legal effect as handwritten signatures.

However, it's important to note that the legal admissibility and effects of electronic signatures may be subject to additional national laws or specific legal requirements for certain types of documents or transactions. The eIDAS Regulation sets the general framework, but Member States can have additional rules regarding the use of electronic signatures in specific contexts.

Article 25 of the eIDAS Regulation states:

"1. An electronic signature shall not be denied legal effect and admissibility as evidence in legal proceedings solely on the grounds that it is in an electronic form or that it does not meet the requirements for qualified electronic signatures.

2. A qualified electronic signature shall have the equivalent legal effect of a handwritten signature."

So in principle, a qualified electronic signature can be used to sign various types of documents or data, as long as it meets the technical requirements outlined in the regulation and complies with any additional national laws or sector-specific regulations that may apply.

Query =>  what is the process to change a private company into a plc?
Answer =>  To change the status of a private company to a public limited company (plc) under Maltese Company Law, the following process must be followed:

1. The private company must alter its Memorandum and Articles of Association to incorporate all the changes required for a company to hold the status of a public company. This includes:

"A private company may change its status to a public company by altering its memorandum or articles and incorporating in such alteration all those changes required by the provisions of this Act for a company to hold the status of a public company, including the removal of the restrictions resulting by virtue of the provisions of article 209 which conflict with the status of a public company." (Article 213(1))

2. The name of the company must be changed to end with the words "public limited company" or the abbreviation "p.l.c.".

"Subject to the provisions of sub-articles (3) to (6), a public company may be designated by any name, but such name must end with the words "public limited company" or their abbreviation "p.l.c.":" (Article 70(1))

3. The company must deliver the following documents to the Registrar for registration:

a) The altered Memorandum and Articles of Association
b) A copy of a balance sheet prepared not more than 4 months before the registration date
c) A declaration by directors that between the balance sheet date and registration date, there has been no change in the company's financial position resulting in net assets becoming less than the called up share capital and undistributable reserves.

"Where a private company changes its status to a public company in accordance with the provisions of this article, the company shall, in addition to the documents referred to in sub-article (2), deliver to the Registrar for registration - 
(a) a copy of a balance sheet prepared as at a date being not more than four months before the date of the registration of the alteration referred to in sub-article (2);
(b) a declaration made by the directors of the company that between the balance sheet date and the date of delivery of the alteration to the Registrar for registration, there has been no change in the company's financial position that has resulted in the amount of its net assets becoming less than the aggregate of its called up issued share capital and undistributable reserves." (Article 213(11))

4. The Registrar will register the alteration and issue a new certificate of registration reflecting the change to a public limited company.

"The Registrar shall, upon delivery of the documents referred to in sub-article (2) and (11), register the alteration and he shall issue a certificate of registration altered to reflect that change." (Article 213(3))

Query =>  From an EU law standpoint, what considerations should be taken when a cross border merger takes place
Answer =>  When a cross-border merger takes place between companies from different EU Member States, there are several important considerations from an EU law standpoint, as outlined in Directive (EU) 2017/1132 relating to certain aspects of Company Law:

1. Types of companies eligible for cross-border merger:
Article 120 states that "Save as otherwise provided in this Chapter, (a) cross-border mergers shall only be possible between types of companies which may merge under the national law of the relevant Member States."

This means that the national laws of the Member States involved must permit mergers between the specific types of companies seeking to undertake the cross-border merger.

2. Compliance with national laws:
Article 120 further states that "(b) a company taking part in a cross-border merger shall comply with the provisions and formalities of the national law to which it is subject."

So each company involved must follow the merger procedures and formalities prescribed by its own national company law.

3. Common draft terms of cross-border merger:
Article 122 specifies the minimum particulars that must be included in the common draft terms of a cross-border merger, such as:
- The proposed form, name and registered office of the companies involved and the resulting company
- The share exchange ratio and any cash payments
- The terms for allocation of shares in the resulting company
- The likely impact on employment
- Key dates related to share entitlements, accounting treatment, etc.

4. Protection of interests of members and others:
Recital 61 states that "In order to protect the interests of members and others, the legal effects of the cross-border merger, distinguishing as to whether the company resulting from the cross-border merger is an acquiring company or a new company, should be specified."

Article 131 then details the specific consequences/effects of a cross-border merger for the companies involved, their assets/liabilities, and their members.

5. Monitoring and approval process:
Recital 60 notes that "monitoring of the completion and legality of the decision-making process in each merging company should be carried out by the national authority having jurisdiction over each of those companies, whereas monitoring of the completion and legality of the cross-border merger should be carried out by the national authority having jurisdiction over the company resulting from the cross-border merger."

So there is oversight by relevant national authorities at various stages.

Sources:
- DIRECTIVE (EU) 2017/1132, Recitals 56-64, Articles 120, 122, 131

The key considerations revolve around eligibility of the company types, compliance with respective national laws, specifying common draft merger terms, protecting interests of stakeholders, and oversight by relevant national authorities. The Directive aims to facilitate cross-border mergers while ensuring they occur in an orderly manner adhering to necessary regulations.

Query =>  explain more about the monitoring and approval process in detail
Answer =>  The monitoring and approval process for cross-border mergers under EU law involves oversight by the relevant national authorities at various stages, as per Directive (EU) 2017/1132. Here are some more details:

1. Monitoring by national authorities of each merging company:
Recital 60 states that "monitoring of the completion and legality of the decision-making process in each merging company should be carried out by the national authority having jurisdiction over each of those companies..."

This means the national authority in each Member State where the merging companies are incorporated/registered will monitor and ensure the merger decision-making process in those companies complies with relevant national laws.

2. Scrutiny of the common draft terms of merger:
Article 123 requires each merging company to make the common draft terms of the cross-border merger publicly available and submit them for scrutiny to the national authority mentioned in paragraph 1 above.

3. Independent expert reports:
Article 125 mandates that for each merging company, one or more independent experts must examine and report on the common draft terms to the company's members. The national authority can appoint these independent experts.

4. Approval by the general meeting:
Article 126 states that after taking note of the reports mentioned above, the general meeting of members of each of the merging companies has to approve the common draft terms of the cross-border merger.

5. Scrutiny of the cross-border merger by national authority:
Article 127 requires that the completion of the cross-border merger shall be scrutinized by the national authority of the Member State of the company resulting from the merger, to ensure it complies with all procedures and formalities.

6. Issue of pre-merger certificate: 
If that national authority is satisfied that all requirements have been met, it shall issue a pre-merger certificate conclusively attesting to the proper completion of the pre-merger acts and formalities (Article 127).

So in summary, there is multi-layered monitoring and approval involving national authorities of each merging company as well as the company resulting from the merger - scrutinizing draft terms, expert reports, member approvals and overall compliance with procedures.

Answer =>  Based on the provided memorandum and articles of association, here are my observations regarding compliance with the Companies Act 1995 of Malta:

1. The memorandum appears to be generally compliant, covering the required elements like company name, status as a private company, registered office, objects, capital structure, and limited liability.

2. The articles cover essential aspects like share transfers, proceedings at general meetings, appointment and powers of directors, share issues, etc. However, there are a few potential areas of concern:

a) Article 4(i) allows share transfers to affiliates without restrictions, which may conflict with the pre-emption rights process outlined earlier in the same article. This could potentially violate Section 109 of the Companies Act regarding equal treatment of shareholders.

b) Article 5(a) requires an extraordinary resolution for pledging ordinary A shares, which is more restrictive than Article 122 of the Companies Act that allows share pledging without such a resolution.

c) Article 6(d) lists certain "Shareholders Reserved Matters" requiring an extraordinary resolution, which is generally allowed under the Companies Act. However, some of the listed matters like establishing director remuneration (Article 6(d)(c)) may conflict with Article 137 of the Act, which requires an ordinary resolution for this purpose.

d) Article 7.1 excludes the application of Sections 57-61 of the First Schedule regarding retirement of directors, which may not be permissible under the Companies Act.

e) Article 7.7 imposes additional restrictions on directors with interests in contracts, beyond the requirements of Article 145 of the Companies Act.

3. There are also a few missing elements that should be considered:

a) No provisions for the appointment and removal of auditors, as required by Article 153 of the Companies Act.

b) No provisions for the keeping of accounting records and laying of accounts, as required by Articles 171-177 of the Act.

c) No provisions for the winding up of the company, as outlined in Articles 214-365 of the Act.

In summary, while the memorandum and articles cover most essential aspects, there are a few potential areas of non-compliance or conflict with the Companies Act 1995. It would be advisable to review and amend the articles to ensure full compliance with the Act.

Query =>  explain in detail - d) Article 7.1 excludes the application of Sections 57-61 of the First Schedule regarding retirement of directors, which may not be permissible under the Companies Act.
Answer =>  Article 7.1 of the provided Articles of Association states:

"Sections 57 - 61 of Part I of the First Schedule of the Companies Act 1995 shall not apply to the company and the directors of the company shall serve without retirement until death or until they shall retire or be removed in accordance with Section 140 of the Companies Act, 1995."

This provision excludes the application of Sections 57-61 of the First Schedule to the Companies Act, which deal with the retirement of directors by rotation.

Specifically, Section 57 requires that at the first annual general meeting, all directors shall retire from office. At subsequent annual general meetings, one-third of the directors (or if their number is not three or a multiple of three, the number nearest to one-third) must retire from office.

By excluding these sections, Article 7.1 effectively allows directors to serve indefinitely without being subject to retirement by rotation at annual general meetings, unless they resign or are removed in accordance with Section 140 of the Act.

This provision may not be permissible under the Companies Act for the following reasons:

1. The Companies Act does not explicitly allow companies to opt-out of the retirement by rotation requirements for directors. These provisions in the First Schedule are meant to apply to all companies unless specifically exempted by the Act itself.

2. The retirement by rotation requirements are considered an important corporate governance mechanism, ensuring periodic accountability of directors to shareholders.

3. Section 109 of the Companies Act requires equal treatment of shareholders of the same class in all respects. By allowing directors to serve indefinitely without re-election, this provision could be seen as violating the rights of shareholders to periodically vote on the composition of the board.

Therefore, while the Companies Act allows some flexibility in the articles regarding the management of the company, excluding the application of the retirement by rotation provisions altogether may be considered ultra vires (beyond the powers) and potentially unenforceable.

It would be advisable to either remove this provision or modify it to comply with the spirit of the Companies Act, ensuring a reasonable mechanism for periodic re-election or retirement of directors.

Answer =>  Based on the provided memorandum and articles of association, here are my observations regarding compliance with the Companies Act 1995 of Malta:

1. The memorandum appears to be generally compliant, covering the required elements like company name, status as a private company, registered office, objects, capital structure, and limited liability.

2. The articles cover essential aspects like share transfers, proceedings at general meetings, appointment and powers of directors, share issues, etc. However, there are a few potential areas of concern:

a) Article 4(i) allows share transfers to affiliates without restrictions, which may conflict with the pre-emption rights process outlined earlier in the same article. This could potentially violate Section 109 of the Companies Act regarding equal treatment of shareholders.

b) Article 5(a) requires an extraordinary resolution for pledging ordinary A shares, which is more restrictive than Article 122 of the Companies Act that allows share pledging without such a resolution.

c) Article 6(d) lists certain "Shareholders Reserved Matters" requiring an extraordinary resolution, which is generally allowed under the Companies Act. However, some of the listed matters like establishing director remuneration (Article 6(d)(c)) may conflict with Article 137 of the Act, which requires an ordinary resolution for this purpose.

d) Article 7.1 excludes the application of Sections 57-61 of the First Schedule regarding retirement of directors, which may not be permissible under the Companies Act.

e) Article 7.7 imposes additional restrictions on directors with interests in contracts, beyond the requirements of Article 145 of the Companies Act.

3. There are also a few missing elements that should be considered:

a) No provisions for the appointment and removal of auditors, as required by Article 153 of the Companies Act.

b) No provisions for the keeping of accounting records and laying of accounts, as required by Articles 171-177 of the Act.

c) No provisions for the winding up of the company, as outlined in Articles 214-365 of the Act.

In summary, while the memorandum and articles cover most essential aspects, there are a few potential areas of non-compliance or conflict with the Companies Act 1995. It would be advisable to review and amend the articles to ensure full compliance with the Act.

Query =>  what does section 57 specifically say
Answer =>  Section 57 of the First Schedule to the Companies Act 1995 deals with the retirement of directors by rotation. The relevant text is:

"57. (1) At the first annual general meeting of the company all the directors shall retire from office, and at the annual general meeting in every subsequent year one-third of the directors for the time being, or, if their number is not three or a multiple of three, then the number nearest one-third, shall retire from office.

(2) The directors to retire in every year shall be those who have been longest in office since their last election, but as between persons who became directors on the same day those to retire shall (unless they otherwise agree among themselves) be determined by lot.

(3) A retiring director shall be eligible for re-election.

(4) The company at the meeting at which a director retires in manner aforesaid may fill the vacated office by electing a person thereto, and in default the retiring director shall, if offering himself for re-election, be deemed to have been re-elected, unless at such meeting it is expressly resolved not to fill such vacated office or unless a resolution for the re-election of such director shall have been put to the meeting and lost."

In essence, it requires that at the first AGM all directors retire, and at subsequent AGMs, one-third of the directors must retire by rotation based on longest time in office. The retiring directors are eligible for re-election unless the shareholders expressly resolve otherwise.

By excluding the application of Sections 57-61 as stated in Article 7.1 of the company's Articles, it allows the directors to remain in office indefinitely without being subject to this periodic retirement and re-election process, which may conflict with the spirit and intent of the Companies Act provisions on corporate governance.
Query =>  explain in detail - d) Article 7.1 excludes the application of Sections 57-61 of the First Schedule regarding retirement of directors, which may not be permissible under the Companies Act.
Answer =>  Article 7.1 of the provided Articles of Association states:

"Sections 57 - 61 of Part I of the First Schedule of the Companies Act 1995 shall not apply to the company and the directors of the company shall serve without retirement until death or until they shall retire or be removed in accordance with Section 140 of the Companies Act, 1995."

This provision excludes the application of Sections 57-61 of the First Schedule to the Companies Act, which deal with the retirement of directors by rotation.

Specifically, Section 57 requires that at the first annual general meeting, all directors shall retire from office. At subsequent annual general meetings, one-third of the directors (or if their number is not three or a multiple of three, the number nearest to one-third) must retire from office.

By excluding these sections, Article 7.1 effectively allows directors to serve indefinitely without being subject to retirement by rotation at annual general meetings, unless they resign or are removed in accordance with Section 140 of the Act.

This provision may not be permissible under the Companies Act for the following reasons:

1. The Companies Act does not explicitly allow companies to opt-out of the retirement by rotation requirements for directors. These provisions in the First Schedule are meant to apply to all companies unless specifically exempted by the Act itself.

2. The retirement by rotation requirements are considered an important corporate governance mechanism, ensuring periodic accountability of directors to shareholders.

3. Section 109 of the Companies Act requires equal treatment of shareholders of the same class in all respects. By allowing directors to serve indefinitely without re-election, this provision could be seen as violating the rights of shareholders to periodically vote on the composition of the board.

Therefore, while the Companies Act allows some flexibility in the articles regarding the management of the company, excluding the application of the retirement by rotation provisions altogether may be considered ultra vires (beyond the powers) and potentially unenforceable.

It would be advisable to either remove this provision or modify it to comply with the spirit of the Companies Act, ensuring a reasonable mechanism for periodic re-election or retirement of directors.

Answer =>  Based on the provided memorandum and articles of association, here are my observations regarding compliance with the Companies Act 1995 of Malta:

1. The memorandum appears to be generally compliant, covering the required elements like company name, status as a private company, registered office, objects, capital structure, and limited liability.

2. The articles cover essential aspects like share transfers, proceedings at general meetings, appointment and powers of directors, share issues, etc. However, there are a few potential areas of concern:

a) Article 4(i) allows share transfers to affiliates without restrictions, which may conflict with the pre-emption rights process outlined earlier in the same article. This could potentially violate Section 109 of the Companies Act regarding equal treatment of shareholders.

b) Article 5(a) requires an extraordinary resolution for pledging ordinary A shares, which is more restrictive than Article 122 of the Companies Act that allows share pledging without such a resolution.

c) Article 6(d) lists certain "Shareholders Reserved Matters" requiring an extraordinary resolution, which is generally allowed under the Companies Act. However, some of the listed matters like establishing director remuneration (Article 6(d)(c)) may conflict with Article 137 of the Act, which requires an ordinary resolution for this purpose.

d) Article 7.1 excludes the application of Sections 57-61 of the First Schedule regarding retirement of directors, which may not be permissible under the Companies Act.

e) Article 7.7 imposes additional restrictions on directors with interests in contracts, beyond the requirements of Article 145 of the Companies Act.

3. There are also a few missing elements that should be considered:

a) No provisions for the appointment and removal of auditors, as required by Article 153 of the Companies Act.

b) No provisions for the keeping of accounting records and laying of accounts, as required by Articles 171-177 of the Act.

c) No provisions for the winding up of the company, as outlined in Articles 214-365 of the Act.

In summary, while the memorandum and articles cover most essential aspects, there are a few potential areas of non-compliance or conflict with the Companies Act 1995. It would be advisable to review and amend the articles to ensure full compliance with the Act.

Answer =>  Here is a draft email to the service provider who created the Memorandum and Articles of Association, explaining the findings regarding compliance with the Companies Act 1995 of Malta:

Subject: Review of Memorandum & Articles of Association for Binderr Ltd  

Dear [Service Provider],

I am writing regarding the Memorandum and Articles of Association you prepared for our company Binderr Ltd. We have reviewed the documents against the requirements of the Companies Act 1995 of Malta, and would like to bring the following observations to your attention:

1. Article 4(i) allows share transfers to affiliates without restrictions, which may conflict with the pre-emption rights process outlined earlier and violate Section 109 of the Act regarding equal treatment of shareholders.

2. Article 5(a) requires an extraordinary resolution for pledging ordinary A shares, which is more restrictive than permitted under Article 122 of the Act.  

3. Article 6(d)(c) lists establishing director remuneration as a "Shareholders Reserved Matter" requiring an extraordinary resolution, while Article 137 of the Act requires only an ordinary resolution for this.

4. Article 7.1 excludes the application of Sections 57-61 of the First Schedule regarding retirement of directors by rotation, which may not be permissible under the Act.

5. Article 7.7 imposes additional restrictions on directors with interests in contracts, beyond the requirements of Article 145 of the Act.

6. The Articles lack provisions for appointment/removal of auditors (required under Article 153), keeping of accounting records and laying of accounts (Articles 171-177), and winding up of the company (Articles 214-365).

While the documents cover most essential aspects, the above-mentioned potential areas of non-compliance or conflict with the Companies Act 1995 should be reviewed and amended as necessary to ensure full compliance.

I would appreciate if you could review these observations and provide your recommendations for aligning the Memorandum and Articles with the Act's requirements.

Thank you for your assistance. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
[Your name]
Query =>  what does section 57 specifically say
Answer =>  Section 57 of the First Schedule to the Companies Act 1995 deals with the retirement of directors by rotation. The relevant text is:

"57. (1) At the first annual general meeting of the company all the directors shall retire from office, and at the annual general meeting in every subsequent year one-third of the directors for the time being, or, if their number is not three or a multiple of three, then the number nearest one-third, shall retire from office.

(2) The directors to retire in every year shall be those who have been longest in office since their last election, but as between persons who became directors on the same day those to retire shall (unless they otherwise agree among themselves) be determined by lot.

(3) A retiring director shall be eligible for re-election.

(4) The company at the meeting at which a director retires in manner aforesaid may fill the vacated office by electing a person thereto, and in default the retiring director shall, if offering himself for re-election, be deemed to have been re-elected, unless at such meeting it is expressly resolved not to fill such vacated office or unless a resolution for the re-election of such director shall have been put to the meeting and lost."

In essence, it requires that at the first AGM all directors retire, and at subsequent AGMs, one-third of the directors must retire by rotation based on longest time in office. The retiring directors are eligible for re-election unless the shareholders expressly resolve otherwise.

By excluding the application of Sections 57-61 as stated in Article 7.1 of the company's Articles, it allows the directors to remain in office indefinitely without being subject to this periodic retirement and re-election process, which may conflict with the spirit and intent of the Companies Act provisions on corporate governance.
Query =>  explain in detail - d) Article 7.1 excludes the application of Sections 57-61 of the First Schedule regarding retirement of directors, which may not be permissible under the Companies Act.
Answer =>  Article 7.1 of the provided Articles of Association states:

"Sections 57 - 61 of Part I of the First Schedule of the Companies Act 1995 shall not apply to the company and the directors of the company shall serve without retirement until death or until they shall retire or be removed in accordance with Section 140 of the Companies Act, 1995."

This provision excludes the application of Sections 57-61 of the First Schedule to the Companies Act, which deal with the retirement of directors by rotation.

Specifically, Section 57 requires that at the first annual general meeting, all directors shall retire from office. At subsequent annual general meetings, one-third of the directors (or if their number is not three or a multiple of three, the number nearest to one-third) must retire from office.

By excluding these sections, Article 7.1 effectively allows directors to serve indefinitely without being subject to retirement by rotation at annual general meetings, unless they resign or are removed in accordance with Section 140 of the Act.

This provision may not be permissible under the Companies Act for the following reasons:

1. The Companies Act does not explicitly allow companies to opt-out of the retirement by rotation requirements for directors. These provisions in the First Schedule are meant to apply to all companies unless specifically exempted by the Act itself.

2. The retirement by rotation requirements are considered an important corporate governance mechanism, ensuring periodic accountability of directors to shareholders.

3. Section 109 of the Companies Act requires equal treatment of shareholders of the same class in all respects. By allowing directors to serve indefinitely without re-election, this provision could be seen as violating the rights of shareholders to periodically vote on the composition of the board.

Therefore, while the Companies Act allows some flexibility in the articles regarding the management of the company, excluding the application of the retirement by rotation provisions altogether may be considered ultra vires (beyond the powers) and potentially unenforceable.

It would be advisable to either remove this provision or modify it to comply with the spirit of the Companies Act, ensuring a reasonable mechanism for periodic re-election or retirement of directors.

Answer =>  Based on the provided memorandum and articles of association, here are my observations regarding compliance with the Companies Act 1995 of Malta:

1. The memorandum appears to be generally compliant, covering the required elements like company name, status as a private company, registered office, objects, capital structure, and limited liability.

2. The articles cover essential aspects like share transfers, proceedings at general meetings, appointment and powers of directors, share issues, etc. However, there are a few potential areas of concern:

a) Article 4(i) allows share transfers to affiliates without restrictions, which may conflict with the pre-emption rights process outlined earlier in the same article. This could potentially violate Section 109 of the Companies Act regarding equal treatment of shareholders.

b) Article 5(a) requires an extraordinary resolution for pledging ordinary A shares, which is more restrictive than Article 122 of the Companies Act that allows share pledging without such a resolution.

c) Article 6(d) lists certain "Shareholders Reserved Matters" requiring an extraordinary resolution, which is generally allowed under the Companies Act. However, some of the listed matters like establishing director remuneration (Article 6(d)(c)) may conflict with Article 137 of the Act, which requires an ordinary resolution for this purpose.

d) Article 7.1 excludes the application of Sections 57-61 of the First Schedule regarding retirement of directors, which may not be permissible under the Companies Act.

e) Article 7.7 imposes additional restrictions on directors with interests in contracts, beyond the requirements of Article 145 of the Companies Act.

3. There are also a few missing elements that should be considered:

a) No provisions for the appointment and removal of auditors, as required by Article 153 of the Companies Act.

b) No provisions for the keeping of accounting records and laying of accounts, as required by Articles 171-177 of the Act.

c) No provisions for the winding up of the company, as outlined in Articles 214-365 of the Act.

In summary, while the memorandum and articles cover most essential aspects, there are a few potential areas of non-compliance or conflict with the Companies Act 1995. It would be advisable to review and amend the articles to ensure full compliance with the Act.

Answer =>  Here is a draft email explaining in detail the potential areas of non-compliance with the Companies Act 1995 in the Memorandum and Articles of Association for Binderr Ltd:

Subject: Review of Memorandum & Articles of Association for Binderr Ltd  

Dear [Service Provider],

I am writing regarding the Memorandum and Articles of Association you prepared for our company Binderr Ltd. We have reviewed the documents against the requirements of the Companies Act 1995 of Malta, and would like to bring the following observations to your attention:

1. Article 4(i) allows share transfers to affiliates without restrictions, which may conflict with the pre-emption rights process outlined earlier and violate Section 109 of the Act regarding equal treatment of shareholders.

Specifically, Section 109 requires all shares to be offered to existing shareholders proportionately before being offered to non-shareholders. By exempting affiliate transfers from this pre-emption process, Article 4(i) could be seen as discriminatory treatment of certain shareholders.

2. Article 5(a) requires an extraordinary resolution for pledging ordinary A shares, which is more restrictive than permitted under Article 122 of the Act.  

Article 122 allows companies to permit share pledging without needing an extraordinary resolution, as long as this is stated in the articles. By requiring such a resolution for ordinary A shares, Article 5(a) imposes an additional restriction beyond what the Act mandates.

3. Article 6(d)(c) lists establishing director remuneration as a "Shareholders Reserved Matter" requiring an extraordinary resolution, while Article 137 of the Act requires only an ordinary resolution for this.

This conflicts with the Companies Act, which states that director remuneration can be approved by an ordinary resolution unless the articles require a higher threshold.

4. Article 7.1 excludes the application of Sections 57-61 of the First Schedule regarding retirement of directors by rotation, which may not be permissible under the Act.

The Companies Act does not explicitly allow companies to opt-out of these provisions for periodic retirement and re-election of directors. Excluding them altogether could be seen as violating principles of good corporate governance.

5. Article 7.7 imposes additional restrictions on directors with interests in contracts, beyond the requirements of Article 145 of the Act.

While Article 145 prohibits interested directors from voting, Article 7.7 goes further by excluding them from being counted towards quorum as well. This additional restriction may exceed the scope permitted by the Act.

6. The Articles lack provisions for appointment/removal of auditors (required under Article 153), keeping of accounting records and laying of accounts (Articles 171-177), and winding up of the company (Articles 214-365).

These are essential aspects that should be covered in the company's articles to ensure compliance with the relevant sections of the Companies Act.

While the documents cover most essential aspects, the above-mentioned potential areas of non-compliance or conflict with the Companies Act 1995 should be reviewed and amended as necessary to ensure full compliance.

I would appreciate if you could review these observations and provide your recommendations for aligning the Memorandum and Articles with the Act's requirements.

Thank you for your assistance. I look forward to your response.

Query =>  what does section 57 specifically say
Answer =>  Section 57 of the First Schedule to the Companies Act 1995 deals with the retirement of directors by rotation. The relevant text is:

"57. (1) At the first annual general meeting of the company all the directors shall retire from office, and at the annual general meeting in every subsequent year one-third of the directors for the time being, or, if their number is not three or a multiple of three, then the number nearest one-third, shall retire from office.

(2) The directors to retire in every year shall be those who have been longest in office since their last election, but as between persons who became directors on the same day those to retire shall (unless they otherwise agree among themselves) be determined by lot.

(3) A retiring director shall be eligible for re-election.

(4) The company at the meeting at which a director retires in manner aforesaid may fill the vacated office by electing a person thereto, and in default the retiring director shall, if offering himself for re-election, be deemed to have been re-elected, unless at such meeting it is expressly resolved not to fill such vacated office or unless a resolution for the re-election of such director shall have been put to the meeting and lost."

In essence, it requires that at the first AGM all directors retire, and at subsequent AGMs, one-third of the directors must retire by rotation based on longest time in office. The retiring directors are eligible for re-election unless the shareholders expressly resolve otherwise.

By excluding the application of Sections 57-61 as stated in Article 7.1 of the company's Articles, it allows the directors to remain in office indefinitely without being subject to this periodic retirement and re-election process, which may conflict with the spirit and intent of the Companies Act provisions on corporate governance.
Query =>  explain in detail - d) Article 7.1 excludes the application of Sections 57-61 of the First Schedule regarding retirement of directors, which may not be permissible under the Companies Act.
Answer =>  Article 7.1 of the provided Articles of Association states:

"Sections 57 - 61 of Part I of the First Schedule of the Companies Act 1995 shall not apply to the company and the directors of the company shall serve without retirement until death or until they shall retire or be removed in accordance with Section 140 of the Companies Act, 1995."

This provision excludes the application of Sections 57-61 of the First Schedule to the Companies Act, which deal with the retirement of directors by rotation.

Specifically, Section 57 requires that at the first annual general meeting, all directors shall retire from office. At subsequent annual general meetings, one-third of the directors (or if their number is not three or a multiple of three, the number nearest to one-third) must retire from office.

By excluding these sections, Article 7.1 effectively allows directors to serve indefinitely without being subject to retirement by rotation at annual general meetings, unless they resign or are removed in accordance with Section 140 of the Act.

This provision may not be permissible under the Companies Act for the following reasons:

1. The Companies Act does not explicitly allow companies to opt-out of the retirement by rotation requirements for directors. These provisions in the First Schedule are meant to apply to all companies unless specifically exempted by the Act itself.

2. The retirement by rotation requirements are considered an important corporate governance mechanism, ensuring periodic accountability of directors to shareholders.

3. Section 109 of the Companies Act requires equal treatment of shareholders of the same class in all respects. By allowing directors to serve indefinitely without re-election, this provision could be seen as violating the rights of shareholders to periodically vote on the composition of the board.

Therefore, while the Companies Act allows some flexibility in the articles regarding the management of the company, excluding the application of the retirement by rotation provisions altogether may be considered ultra vires (beyond the powers) and potentially unenforceable.

It would be advisable to either remove this provision or modify it to comply with the spirit of the Companies Act, ensuring a reasonable mechanism for periodic re-election or retirement of directors.

Query =>  explain article (Articles 214-365)
Answer =>  Articles 214-365 of the Companies Act 1995 deal with the winding up of companies in Malta. This is a significant part of the Act that covers the various procedures and rules related to the dissolution and liquidation of companies.

Some key aspects covered under Articles 214-365 include:

1. Modes of Winding Up (Articles 214-216)
This outlines the different modes by which a company may be wound up - compulsory winding up by the court, voluntary winding up by members/creditors, or subject to court supervision.

2. Provisions related to Compulsory Winding Up (Articles 217-285)
This extensive section covers the circumstances under which a company may be wound up by the court, who can make an application, powers of the court, appointment and powers of official receivers and provisional administrators, effects of winding up order, duties of liquidators, and many other procedural aspects.

3. Provisions related to Voluntary Winding Up (Articles 286-319)
This covers the procedures for a voluntary winding up, initiation by members/creditors, appointment of liquidators, duties and powers of liquidators, distribution of assets, and dissolution of the company.

4. Provisions Applicable to Every Mode of Winding Up (Articles 320-346)
This includes general rules applicable to all modes of winding up, such as provisions regarding liquidators, exercise of court's powers, deferred debts, preferential payments, disclaimer of onerous property, offences by officers of companies being wound up, and dissolution of the company.

5. Supplemental Provisions (Articles 347-365)
This contains supplementary rules related to winding up, including provisions regarding companies incorporated outside Malta, companies that have been dissolved, and rules related to contributories.

The Articles provide a comprehensive framework governing the entire winding up process, from the circumstances triggering it to the final dissolution of the company. They aim to protect the interests of creditors, shareholders, and other stakeholders while ensuring an orderly and lawful liquidation process.

Given the significance of winding up procedures, it is essential for a company's Articles of Association to incorporate or make reference to these provisions to ensure compliance with the Act.

Subject: Review of Memorandum & Articles of Association for Binderr Ltd  

Dear [Service Provider],

I am writing regarding the Memorandum and Articles of Association you prepared for our company Binderr Ltd. We have reviewed the documents against the requirements of the Companies Act 1995 of Malta, and would like to bring the following observations to your attention:

1. Article 4(i) allows share transfers to affiliates without restrictions, which may conflict with the pre-emption rights process outlined earlier and violate Section 109 of the Act regarding equal treatment of shareholders.

Specifically, Section 109 requires all shares to be offered to existing shareholders proportionately before being offered to non-shareholders. By exempting affiliate transfers from this pre-emption process, Article 4(i) could be seen as discriminatory treatment of certain shareholders.

2. Article 5(a) requires an extraordinary resolution for pledging ordinary A shares, which is more restrictive than permitted under Article 122 of the Act.  

Article 122 allows companies to permit share pledging without needing an extraordinary resolution, as long as this is stated in the articles. By requiring such a resolution for ordinary A shares, Article 5(a) imposes an additional restriction beyond what the Act mandates.

3. Article 6(d)(c) lists establishing director remuneration as a "Shareholders Reserved Matter" requiring an extraordinary resolution, while Article 137 of the Act requires only an ordinary resolution for this.

This conflicts with the Companies Act, which states that director remuneration can be approved by an ordinary resolution unless the articles require a higher threshold.

4. Article 7.1 excludes the application of Sections 57-61 of the First Schedule regarding retirement of directors by rotation, which may not be permissible under the Act.

The Companies Act does not explicitly allow companies to opt-out of these provisions for periodic retirement and re-election of directors. Excluding them altogether could be seen as violating principles of good corporate governance.

5. Article 7.7 imposes additional restrictions on directors with interests in contracts, beyond the requirements of Article 145 of the Act.

While Article 145 prohibits interested directors from voting, Article 7.7 goes further by excluding them from being counted towards quorum as well. This additional restriction may exceed the scope permitted by the Act.

6. The Articles lack provisions for appointment/removal of auditors (required under Article 153), keeping of accounting records and laying of accounts (Articles 171-177), and winding up of the company (Articles 214-365).

These are essential aspects that should be covered in the company's articles to ensure compliance with the relevant sections of the Companies Act.

While the documents cover most essential aspects, the above-mentioned potential areas of non-compliance or conflict with the Companies Act 1995 should be reviewed and amended as necessary to ensure full compliance.

I would appreciate if you could review these observations and provide your recommendations for aligning the Memorandum and Articles with the Act's requirements.

Thank you for your assistance. I look forward to your response.

Query =>  what does section 57 specifically say
Answer =>  Section 57 of the First Schedule to the Companies Act 1995 deals with the retirement of directors by rotation. The relevant text is:

"57. (1) At the first annual general meeting of the company all the directors shall retire from office, and at the annual general meeting in every subsequent year one-third of the directors for the time being, or, if their number is not three or a multiple of three, then the number nearest one-third, shall retire from office.

(2) The directors to retire in every year shall be those who have been longest in office since their last election, but as between persons who became directors on the same day those to retire shall (unless they otherwise agree among themselves) be determined by lot.

(3) A retiring director shall be eligible for re-election.

(4) The company at the meeting at which a director retires in manner aforesaid may fill the vacated office by electing a person thereto, and in default the retiring director shall, if offering himself for re-election, be deemed to have been re-elected, unless at such meeting it is expressly resolved not to fill such vacated office or unless a resolution for the re-election of such director shall have been put to the meeting and lost."

In essence, it requires that at the first AGM all directors retire, and at subsequent AGMs, one-third of the directors must retire by rotation based on longest time in office. The retiring directors are eligible for re-election unless the shareholders expressly resolve otherwise.

By excluding the application of Sections 57-61 as stated in Article 7.1 of the company's Articles, it allows the directors to remain in office indefinitely without being subject to this periodic retirement and re-election process, which may conflict with the spirit and intent of the Companies Act provisions on corporate governance.

Query =>  list article 347
Answer =>  Unfortunately, the full text of Article 347 is not provided in the context given. However, based on the information that Article 347 falls under the "Supplemental Provisions" section of the Companies Act 1995 (Articles 347-365), I can infer that it likely contains supplementary rules related to the winding up of companies.

The context mentions that the "Supplemental Provisions" section "contains supplementary rules related to winding up, including provisions regarding companies incorporated outside Malta, companies that have been dissolved, and rules related to contributories."

Without the specific text, I cannot provide the exact details of what Article 347 covers. However, it is reasonable to assume that it deals with some supplementary aspect related to the winding up process, potentially concerning companies incorporated outside Malta, dissolved companies, or rules for contributories (parties liable to contribute to the assets of a company being wound up).

I apologize that I cannot give you the precise contents of Article 347, as the relevant text from the Companies Act is not included in the provided context. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional information that could help me better understand and explain this article.
Query =>  explain article (Articles 214-365)
Answer =>  Articles 214-365 of the Companies Act 1995 deal with the winding up of companies in Malta. This is a significant part of the Act that covers the various procedures and rules related to the dissolution and liquidation of companies.

Some key aspects covered under Articles 214-365 include:

1. Modes of Winding Up (Articles 214-216)
This outlines the different modes by which a company may be wound up - compulsory winding up by the court, voluntary winding up by members/creditors, or subject to court supervision.

2. Provisions related to Compulsory Winding Up (Articles 217-285)
This extensive section covers the circumstances under which a company may be wound up by the court, who can make an application, powers of the court, appointment and powers of official receivers and provisional administrators, effects of winding up order, duties of liquidators, and many other procedural aspects.

3. Provisions related to Voluntary Winding Up (Articles 286-319)

Query =>  Where can a maltese gaming license be used
Answer =>  According to the "Gaming Premises Regulations" (Document Name: GAMING PREMISES REGULATIONS - SL583-07), gaming services in Malta are subject to certain restrictions and requirements:

1. Gaming services can only be provided on authorized premises within Malta. Regulation 2 states:

"No gaming service may be provided on vessels, aircraft or other vehicles in Malta, with the exception of authorised cruise casinos."

2. The regulations cover the approval process for gaming premises within Malta, registration of players, self-exclusion procedures, and rules for controlled gaming premises.

3. As for the geographical scope of a Maltese gaming license, the "Gaming Authorisations Regulations" (Document Name: GAMING AUTHORISATIONS REGULATIONS - SL583.05) provide some relevant information:

Regulation 10(1) states: "A person is not eligible to hold a licence unless such person is established in the European Economic Area."

This suggests that a Maltese gaming license allows the licensee to operate within the European Economic Area (EEA), which comprises the EU member states and certain other European countries.

However, the regulations do not explicitly restrict the use of the license only within Malta or the EEA. The licensing requirements, such as the location of technical infrastructure (data centers, servers, etc.), are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, including potential locations outside the EEA (Regulation 10(3)).

In summary, while a Maltese gaming license is primarily intended for operating within Malta and the EEA, the geographical scope may extend beyond these regions, subject to meeting the licensing authority's assessments and requirements for each specific case.

Query =>  Can a non maltese company apply for a license
Answer =>  Yes, a non-Maltese company can apply for a gaming license in Malta, provided it meets certain eligibility criteria outlined in the Gaming Authorisations Regulations (S.L.583.05). Specifically, regulation 10(1) states:

"A person is not eligible to hold a licence unless such person is established in the European Economic Area."

So the key requirement is that the applicant company must be established (have a legal presence/registered office) in the European Economic Area (EEA), which includes all European Union member states as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.

The regulations also allow a body corporate applicant to apply for a license either for itself or for its entire corporate group, as per regulation 10(2):

"Where the applicant for a licence is a body corporate, such applicant may apply for a licence either for itself only or for its corporate group."

To summarize, a non-Maltese company established in any EEA country is eligible to apply for a Malta gaming license, either just for itself or covering its whole corporate group.

Query =>  what tax regimes are applicable for gaming licenses
Answer =>  The tax regimes applicable for gaming licenses in Malta are outlined in the Gaming Tax Regulations (S.L.583.10). There are two main tax components:

1. Gaming Tax

As per Part II, Regulation 3 of the Gaming Tax Regulations, any person offering gaming services to players physically present in Malta (or established/residing in Malta for remote gaming) must pay a gaming tax of 5% of the gaming revenue generated during each tax period.

The definition of "gaming revenue" is provided in the regulations:

"gaming revenue" means the aggregate stakes and wagers, inclusive of any bonus or other player incentives which are comprised within any stake or wager, less an amount to be determined by summing up the aggregate player winnings to the aggregate of any bonus or other player incentives which are comprised within the amount of aggregate stakes and wagers..."

(Source: Gaming Tax Regulations, S.L.583.10, Part II, Regulation 3)

2. Levy on Gaming Devices 

Part III, Regulations 4 and 5 outline a levy payable on gaming devices used to provide gaming services. The levy rate varies based on the type of gaming service and location:

- 30% of gaming revenue for Type 1 (casino-type games) and Type 2 (lotteries) gaming in gaming premises

- 12.5% of gaming revenue for Type 3 (games of chance) and Type 4 (skill games) in gaming premises  

- 15% of gaming revenue for Type 1, 2, 3, 4 in controlled gaming premises

- 2.5% of gaming revenue for Type 3 classified as a "junket event"

(Source: Gaming Tax Regulations, S.L.583.10, Part III, Regulations 4 and 5)

So in summary, gaming licensees in Malta are subject to a 5% gaming tax on revenue as well as a levy ranging from 2.5% to 30% on gaming device revenue, depending on the service type and location.

Answer =>  According to the Companies Act of Malta, auditors have certain obligations and rights in relation to the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of a company. Here are the key provisions:

1. The auditors' report must be read before the company at the AGM (Article 179(2)):
"The auditors' report shall be read before the company in general meeting, and be open to the inspection of any member of the company."

2. Auditors have the right to attend and be heard at any general meeting, including the AGM (Article 155):
"A company's auditors shall be entitled -
(a) to receive all notices of, and other communications relating to, any general meeting which a member of the company is entitled to receive;
(b) to attend any general meeting of the company; and 
(c) to be heard at any general meeting which they attend on any part of the business of the meeting which concerns them as auditors."

3. If the auditors have resigned, they still have the right to attend the AGM and be heard on matters concerning them as former auditors (Article 87(7)):
"An auditor who has resigned has, notwithstanding his resignation, the rights conferred by regulation 87 in relation to any such general meeting of the company as is mentioned in subregulation (3)(a) or (b), and, in such a case, the references in that regulation to matters concerning the auditor as auditor shall be construed accordingly."

4. If the directors fail to circulate the auditors' statement to members before the AGM, the auditor can require that the statement be read out at the meeting (Article 87(6)):
"If a copy of the statement is not sent out as required because it was received too late or because of the company's default, the auditor may, without prejudice to his right to be heard orally, require that the statement be read out at the meeting."

Query =>  what are the annual fees applicable to an ltd
Answer =>  The Companies Act (Fees) Regulations (S.L. 386.03) specify the annual fees applicable to a limited liability company (Ltd) in Malta. Here are the relevant provisions:

Registration of an annual return of a company other than an investment company with variable share capital (Regulation 5(i)):

So in summary, the annual return filing fee for an Ltd company ranges from €85 to €1,400, depending on the authorized share capital amount.

Query =>  assuming there are 4 shareholders in a company, 2 own 90% between them and 1 owns 6% and another one 4%. Who has a right to elect a director and what is the minimum number of directors
Answer =>  According to the Companies Act of Malta, the right to appoint directors depends on the provisions in the company's memorandum and articles of association. However, the Act provides some general rules:

1. Appointment of directors (Article 137(3)):
"Unless otherwise provided in the memorandum or articles of a company, a director of a company other than the first directors shall be appointed by ordinary resolution of the company in general meeting."

2. Right of class shareholders to appoint directors (Article 137(4)): 
"Where the holders of a particular class of shares have the right to appoint one or more directors, in terms of the memorandum and articles of the company, such appointment shall be made by a member or members holding in the aggregate more than fifty per cent in nominal value of the shares represented and entitled to vote at the meeting of the holders of the shares of that class."

In the scenario provided:
- The two shareholders owning 90% between them would likely have the right to appoint directors by ordinary resolution, unless the articles state otherwise.
- The shareholder with 6% may or may not have a right to appoint a director, depending on the articles.
- The shareholder with 4% is unlikely to have the right to appoint a director individually.

As for the minimum number of directors, Article 137(1) states:
"Every company shall have at least two directors."

So the minimum number of directors required for this company would be two.

However, the specific rights and procedures would depend on what is stated in the company's memorandum and articles of association.

Query =>  Let us assume that there is a fundraise and the shareholder with 4% cannot partake and will lead to dilution. What protection does the law offer
Answer =>  The Companies Act of Malta provides certain protections for minority shareholders in the event of a new issue of shares that may lead to dilution of their shareholding.

The key provision is Article 88 which deals with the pre-emptive rights of existing shareholders:

Article 88(1) states:
"Whenever shares of a public company are proposed to be allotted for consideration in cash, those shares shall be offered on a pre-emptive basis to shareholders in proportion to the share capital held by them."

This means that when a company issues new shares for cash, it must first offer those shares to the existing shareholders in proportion to their current shareholdings. This gives all shareholders, including minority holders, the right to subscribe for new shares to maintain their percentage ownership.

However, Article 88(2)(a) allows an exception for shares "which carry a limited right to participate in distributions...or in the company's assets in the event of liquidation."

So if the minority shareholder with 4% holds a class of shares with limited rights, the company may be able to issue new shares without offering them to that shareholder on a pre-emptive basis.

Additionally, Article 88(4) states:
"The right of pre-emption may not be restricted or withdrawn by the statutes or instrument of incorporation. This may, however, be done by decision of the general meeting."

This means the pre-emptive rights can be restricted or withdrawn by a decision of the general meeting, which the majority shareholders can approve.

So in summary, while the law provides pre-emptive rights to protect minority shareholders from dilution, there are exceptions based on the class of shares held and the ability for the majority to override these rights by a general meeting decision.

Query =>  In summary what protection to small shareholders does the law offer
Answer =>  The Companies Act of Malta provides several protections for minority or small shareholders. Here's a summary:

1. Pre-emptive rights (Article 88):
When a company issues new shares for cash, it must first offer those shares to existing shareholders in proportion to their current shareholdings. This allows minority shareholders to maintain their percentage ownership and avoid dilution.

2. Right to appoint directors (Article 137(4)):
If the company's memorandum and articles provide for it, holders of a particular class of shares have the right to appoint one or more directors if they hold more than 50% of the shares in that class.

3. Right to call a general meeting (Article 120(1)(b)): 
Shareholders holding at least 10% of the paid-up share capital can request the directors to convene a general meeting.

4. Right to circulate statements (Article 135(1)(a)):
Shareholders holding at least 10% of the paid-up capital can request the company to circulate statements relating to resolutions or other matters to be discussed at an upcoming general meeting.

5. Right to apply to court (Article 148(1)):
Shareholders holding at least 15% of the issued share capital can apply to court to appoint one or more competent inspectors to investigate the company's affairs.

6. Right to object to mergers/divisions (Article 335(3), 352(3)):
Minority shareholders who voted against a merger or division have the right to exercise exit rights and receive compensation for their shares.

While these provisions aim to protect minority shareholders, it's important to note that the specific rights may depend on the company's memorandum and articles of association.

However, Article 88(2)(a) allows an exception for shares "which carry a limited right to participate in distributions...or in the company's assets in the event of liquidation."

Additionally, Article 88(4) states:
"The right of pre-emption may not be restricted or withdrawn by the statutes or instrument of incorporation. This may, however, be done by decision of the general meeting."

This means the pre-emptive rights can be restricted or withdrawn by a decision of the general meeting, which the majority shareholders can approve.

"Every company shall have at least two directors."

So the minimum number of directors required for this company would be two.

However, the specific rights and procedures would depend on what is stated in the company's memorandum and articles of association.

Query =>  what are the annual fees applicable to an ltd
Answer =>  The Companies Act (Fees) Regulations (S.L. 386.03) specify the annual fees applicable to a limited liability company (Ltd) in Malta. Here are the relevant provisions:

Registration of an annual return of a company other than an investment company with variable share capital (Regulation 5(i)):

If the authorized share capital of the company:

i) does not exceed €1,500 - €100 (paper format) or €85 (electronic format)

ii) exceeds €1,500 but does not exceed €5,000 - €140 (paper) or €120 (electronic)  

iii) exceeds €5,000 but does not exceed €10,000 - €160 (paper) or €135 (electronic)

iv) exceeds €10,000 but does not exceed €50,000 - €350 (paper) or €300 (electronic)

v) exceeds €50,000 but does not exceed €100,000 - €400 (paper) or €340 (electronic)

vi) exceeds €100,000 but does not exceed €250,000 - €600 (paper) or €510 (electronic)  

vii) exceeds €250,000 but does not exceed €500,000 - €800 (paper) or €680 (electronic)

viii) exceeds €500,000 but does not exceed €1,000,000 - €900 (paper) or €765 (electronic)

ix) exceeds €1,000,000 but does not exceed €2,500,000 - €1,200 (paper) or €1,020 (electronic)

x) exceeds €2,500,000 - €1,400 (paper) or €1,200 (electronic)

So in summary, the annual return filing fee for an Ltd company ranges from €85 to €1,400, depending on the authorized share capital amount.

Query =>  What are the corporate tax rates
Answer =>  The documents provided do not appear to contain specific information about corporate tax rates in Malta. The context discusses whistleblower protection related to breaches of corporate tax law and tax evasion schemes, as well as fees for various company filings and penalties under the Companies Act. However, there are no details given on the actual corporate tax rates applicable in Malta.

Since the vector database does not seem to cover corporate tax rates, I cannot provide a substantive answer to that query based solely on the information present in these documents. To get accurate and up-to-date details on Malta's corporate tax rates, one would need to consult other authoritative sources like the Malta tax authorities' website or publications.

Sources:
- Document discussing whistleblower protection directive (sections quoted but no relevant information on tax rates)
- Companies Act fees schedule (no information on tax rates)

Query =>  can a contract between two parties be infinite
Answer =>  No, under Maltese law, a contract cannot be infinite or have an indefinite duration. The Civil Code has provisions that require the subject matter of a contract to be determinate and certain. Specifically:

Article 983(1) states: "The subject of an obligation must be a thing determinate, at least as to its species."

Article 984(1) allows future things to be the subject of a contract, but Article 984(2) prohibits renouncing a succession that has not yet devolved or making any stipulation regarding such a future succession.

These provisions indicate that while contracts can relate to future obligations, the subject matter must still be determinate and cannot be indefinite or infinite in nature.

The law aims to provide certainty in contractual obligations. An infinite or perpetual contract would violate this principle of determinacy required for valid contracts under Maltese law.

Query =>  a minority shareholder of a company is claiming that the company raised money with the deliberate aim to dilute his shareholding as the company could have obtained bank finance instead. what does the law say about this
Answer =>  The Maltese Companies Act and related regulations provide certain protections for minority shareholders against dilution of their shareholdings. However, the company's decision to raise capital through issuing new shares instead of obtaining bank financing is generally within the powers of the company's board of directors and majority shareholders, as long as proper procedures are followed.

The Companies Act, under Article 88, provides pre-emptive rights to existing shareholders when new shares are issued for cash consideration. This means the company must offer the new shares first to the existing shareholders in proportion to their current shareholdings, before offering them to new investors. This gives minority shareholders the opportunity to maintain their percentage ownership by subscribing to the new share issue.

However, Article 88(5) allows the company to restrict or withdraw these pre-emptive rights if authorized by the memorandum or articles of association, and if approved by an extraordinary resolution of the general meeting. So if proper procedures were followed, the company could issue new shares without first offering them to existing shareholders.

The key consideration is whether the share issue was carried out for a proper corporate purpose and benefit, rather than solely to dilute the minority shareholder's stake. The law does not prohibit share issuances that may have a dilutive effect, as long as there is a legitimate business rationale behind it.

Unless there is evidence that the share issue was carried out in bad faith or in violation of the company's constitutional documents or proper procedures, the minority shareholder's claim may not have strong legal grounds. However, the specific circumstances would need to be examined.

Query =>  the reason was just to increase share capital
Answer =>  Based on the information provided in the context documents, if the sole reason for the company to issue new shares and raise additional share capital was to dilute the minority shareholder's stake, without any legitimate business purpose, then the minority shareholder may have grounds to challenge the share issuance.

The Companies Act imposes certain duties on directors when exercising their powers, including the duty to act honestly and in good faith in the best interests of the company (Article 136). Issuing shares solely to dilute a minority shareholder, without any corporate benefit, could potentially be seen as a breach of this duty.

Article 25(1) of the Companies Act states that any increase in the issued share capital shall be decided by an ordinary resolution, unless the company's constitutional documents require a higher voting threshold. However, this power to increase capital is expected to be exercised for proper corporate purposes and not to unfairly prejudice minority shareholders.

If it can be shown that the share issuance was carried out in bad faith, with the primary aim of diluting the minority shareholder's stake rather than for a legitimate business need, the minority shareholder may be able to challenge the decision in court on the grounds of oppression of minority shareholders (Article 402 of the Companies Act).

However, the burden of proof would be on the minority shareholder to demonstrate that the share issuance was carried out improperly and not in the company's best interests. The court would likely examine the specific circumstances, rationale provided by the directors, and whether proper procedures were followed.

Query =>  what remedies does the alleged injured party have?
Answer =>  If a minority shareholder believes that the company issued new shares with the deliberate aim of diluting their shareholding, without a legitimate business purpose, they may have certain remedies available under the Companies Act.

Firstly, the minority shareholder could file a claim in court alleging oppression or unfair prejudice under Article 402 of the Companies Act. This provision allows a shareholder to apply to the court for an order if the company's affairs are being conducted in an oppressive manner or in a way that unfairly prejudices their interests.

If the court finds that the share issuance was carried out in bad faith and primarily to dilute the minority shareholder's stake, without a proper corporate purpose, it may grant relief such as:

1) Regulating the company's affairs in the future (Article 402(1)(a))
2) Requiring the company to buy back the minority shareholder's shares at a fair value (Article 402(1)(b))
3) Awarding compensation to the minority shareholder (Article 402(1)(c))

Additionally, the minority shareholder could potentially claim a breach of directors' duties under Article 136, which requires directors to act honestly and in good faith in the best interests of the company. If it can be shown that the directors acted improperly in issuing shares solely to dilute the minority, the court may order remedies against the directors personally.

However, the burden of proof would be on the minority shareholder to demonstrate that the share issuance lacked a legitimate business rationale and was carried out in bad faith to prejudice their interests.

Query =>  what is the process in the courts
Answer =>  If a minority shareholder wishes to challenge a share issuance by the company on the grounds that it was carried out with the deliberate aim of diluting their shareholding, the process would typically involve filing a claim in the Civil Court.

The relevant provisions under the Companies Act are:

Article 402 - Remedy in case of oppression against minority
This article allows a shareholder to apply to the court for an order if the company's affairs are being conducted in an oppressive manner or in a way that unfairly prejudices their interests as a shareholder.

If the court finds the share issuance was carried out in bad faith to dilute the minority shareholder, without a proper corporate purpose, it may grant relief such as:

1) Regulating the company's affairs in the future (Article 402(1)(a))
2) Requiring the company to buy back the minority shareholder's shares at a fair value (Article 402(1)(b)) 
3) Awarding compensation to the minority shareholder (Article 402(1)(c))

The process would likely involve:

1) The minority shareholder filing an application in the Civil Court under Article 402, alleging oppression/unfair prejudice from the share issuance.

2) The company would file a reply contesting the allegations.

3) The court would hear evidence and submissions from both sides on whether the share issue lacked a legitimate business rationale and was primarily aimed at diluting the minority.

4) If the minority shareholder succeeds, the court can grant appropriate relief per Article 402(1).

The burden of proof would be on the minority shareholder to demonstrate the share issuance was carried out improperly and in bad faith to prejudice their interests.

Query =>  in the case of a listed entity, how much shareholding gives the right to a shareholder to elect a director?
Answer =>  According to the Companies Act of Malta, for listed companies, the right to appoint directors is determined based on the class of shares held by the shareholders and the provisions in the company's memorandum and articles of association.

Specifically, Article 139(3) of the Companies Act states:

"Where the holders of a particular class of shares have the right to appoint one or more directors, in terms of the memorandum and articles of the company, such appointment shall be made by a member or members holding in the aggregate more than fifty per cent in nominal value of the shares represented and entitled to vote at the meeting of the holders of the shares of that class."

This means that if the memorandum and articles of a listed company provide for certain classes of shares to have the right to appoint directors, then the shareholders holding more than 50% of the nominal value of shares in that particular class would have the right to appoint the director(s) allocated to that class.

The key points are:

1) The right to appoint directors is determined by the class of shares held.
2) The specific provisions are laid out in the company's memorandum and articles of association.
3) For the class with the right to appoint directors, shareholders holding over 50% of the nominal value of shares in that class can appoint the director(s).

The Systems Integrator pledges to deliver the Offering, as detailed in the Sales Order or Proposal attached to the Sales Order, with utmost proficiency, professionalism, and in compliance with established industry standards and applicable law. The Systems Integrator's team, equipped with relevant Vendor certifications, will execute the Offering. The Systems Integrator will uphold the principles of integrity, good faith, and fair dealing in all its engagements with the Customer, while strictly observing the stipulations of this Agreement.<br />5.2.	The Systems Integrator hereby acknowledges and consents to the provision of Offering at the Supported Locations. The Parties hereby covenant and agree to collaborate and cooperate in all matters pertaining to the Offering under this Agreement. This collaboration includes, but is not limited to, regular communication, sharing of necessary information, joint problem-solving, and mutual support to achieve the objectives of this Agreement.<br />5.3.	The Customer shall, to the extent required for the provision of the Offering and subject to any obligation the Customer may have to any third party or to applicable laws, furnish all necessary information and afford access to the Supported Locations as may be reasonably required by the Systems Integrator for the effective discharge of its obligations under this Agreement. The Customer acknowledges and accepts that any limitations or delays in providing such necessary information or access may result in delays or limitations in the Systems Integrator's ability to discharge its obligations under this Agreement.<br />5.4.	The Service Provider may, upon receipt of a written request from the Customer through the Change Control Procedure, provide Additional Services to the Customer. The provision of such Additional Services shall be subject to a separate quotation and agreement on the cost thereof prior to the commencement of the Additional Services, as agreed to in writing between the Parties.<br />5.5.	Should the Customer necessitate services beyond the purview of this Agreement ("Out-of-Scope Services"), inclusive of but not limited to services demanded due to emergent situations or other pressing circumstances, such Out-of-Scope Services shall be billed at a rate of ninety five euro (€ 95) excluding VAT per hour per engineer, regardless of whether these services are rendered onsite or remotely.

In addition, the aforementioned out-of-scope charge-out fees are subject to an annual indexation increase of five percent (5%) throughout the term of the Agreement.

The Customer is obliged to ensure that the Installation Sites are aptly prepared and suitable for the implementation of the Products or the delivery of Services by the representatives or engineers of the Systems Integrator. This preparation includes, but is not restricted to, verification of adequate physical space, power supply, network connections, and any additional infrastructure requirements, which should be fulfilled prior to the predetermined installation timeline.

The Customer shall ensure that the necessary Key Customer Personnel are available to facilitate the installation or provision of the services. This may include, but is not limited to, personnel who can provide necessary access, information, or assistance to the System Integrator's engineers or representatives.<br />5.8.	In the event that the Installation Sites are not aptly prepared and suitable for the implementation of the Products or the delivery of Services, or if the necessary Key Customer Personnel are not available as agreed upon by the Parties, the Service Provider may, at its discretion, charge additional fees to cover the costs of rescheduling, additional time, or other resources required due to such delays. The Customer acknowledges and agrees to these potential additional charges.<br />6.	ASSENT TO VENDOR SOFTWARE LICENSING TERMS AND ASSOCIATED RESPONSIBILITIES<br />6.1.	Notwithstanding any other clause in this Agreement, by utilizing the software or systems encompassed under this Agreement, the Customer unconditionally consents to be bound by the licensing terms and conditions specified in the vendor/manufacturer's licensing agreement. Regardless of the Systems Integrator's role in facilitating the initial installation on behalf of and under instruction of the Customer, which may entail assenting to these terms, the Customer's subsequent use of the software constitutes definitive acceptance of such terms and conditions.<br /> <br />6.2.	In the event that the Customer fails to review these terms and conditions, and the Systems Integrator assents to them during the commissioning process, the Customer acknowledges and agrees that they assume all responsibility for the subsequent use and implications of the software under the vendor/manufacturer's terms. The Customer hereby disclaims and releases the Systems Integrator from any claims, liabilities, damages, or responsibilities arising from or connected to the vendor/manufacturer's licensing agreement.<br />6.3.	Prior to acceptance of this Agreement, the Customer is expected to conduct a comprehensive review of the Vendor's licensing, terms, and conditions.

Upon signing, the Customer fully acknowledges and accepts the Vendor's licensing, terms, and conditions.<br />7.	EXCLUSIONS FROM COVER<br />7.1.	Notwithstanding any other clause in this Agreement, the following shall be chargeable to the Customer:<br />7.1.1.	The cost of additional components, equipment, licenses, software or services instructed by the Customer in accordance with the Change Control Procedure to be purchased or otherwise acquired in relation to or as a result of the provision of the Services, unless specified in the Sales Order or the Proposal attached to the Sales Order, as agreed to in writing between the Parties;<br />7.1.2.	Transport, lodging and related costs by Systems Integrator Staff to and from the Customer’s site/s if said site/s are not located in Malta, provided they are approved in advance by the Customer;<br />7.1.3.	Any other costs or disbursements incurred by the Systems Integrator and approved by the Customer; and<br />7.1.4.	Any other Out-of-Scope Services<br />8.	PRICING, PAYMENT, FINANCING AND FINANCIAL CONDITION<br />8.1.	The pricing for the Offering shall be indicated in Sales Order or the Proposal attached to the Sales Order.<br />8.2.	Prices do not include any Value Added Tax (VAT), levies or duties ("Taxes"), unless specified and included in the Sales Order or the Proposal attached to the Sales Order. If the Customer is based outside of Malta, it is the Customer's responsibility to pay any applicable Taxes. For Malta-based companies, VAT or other applicable Taxes will be added to the invoice value unless specified in the Sales Order or the Proposal attached to the Sales Order.<br />8.3.	A partial or full prepayment may be required, to the extent stated in the Sales Order. In such cases, the order will be processed only when such prepayment is received by the Systems Integrator.<br />8.4.	To facilitate certain financing arrangements, the Systems Integrator may assign its receivables from the Customer to a Financial Institution. In such cases, the Customer agrees to fully cooperate with both the Systems Integrator and the Financial Institution, which may include executing additional documentation as required by the Financial Institution. If the Customer opts not to comply with this clause, the Customer undertakes to make a full advance payment encompassing the total value of the Products or Services before the Systems Integrator is obliged to deliver the Products or provide the Professional Services. Under such circumstances, the Systems Integrator will only initiate the processing of any order and commence with the provision of the Offering upon receipt of the entire advance payment.<br />8.5.	The Systems Integrator shall issue invoices to the Customer upon delivery of the Products or completion of the Professional Services, including instances where partial deliveries are made. In such scenarios, the Systems Integrator retains the right to generate invoices for the delivered portion of the Products or services at the time of such delivery or completion, irrespective of whether the delivery constitutes the full extent of all ordered Products or Professional Services. The standard payment conditions stipulate immediate settlement of these invoices upon delivery, unless otherwise specified in the Sales Order or the accompanying Proposal to the Sales Order.<br />8.6.	In the event that the Customer does not fulfil any payment by the established due date, the Systems Integrator is entitled to apply interest to the overdue amount at the maximum rate permitted by applicable law. This interest will accumulate daily from the due date until the actual payment date of the overdue amount. Any payments made by the Customer in this context will first be applied towards covering any accrued interest before being applied to the principal amount. <br />8.7.	Should the payment terms, delineated in the Sales Order or the accompanying Proposal to the Sales Order, allow for the Customer to make phased payments over time, and any such payment becomes overdue by fourteen (14) days, the Systems Integrator reserves the right to demand immediate payment of the total outstanding balance. Upon issuing a written notice to the Customer, the entirety of the outstanding balance will become due and payable within seven (7) days from the date of the notice.<br />8.8.	The Customer shall notify the Systems Integrator in writing within two (2) Business Days of becoming aware of any circumstances that may affect its ability to fulfil its obligations under this Agreement, including financial difficulties, litigation, dissolution, bankruptcy, or any other action that could lead to the winding-up of the company. Upon receiving notice of such circumstances, the Systems Integrator reserves the right to take appropriate measures to protect its interests, including suspending delivery of Products or Professional Services, demanding immediate payment of all amounts due under this Agreement, or terminating this Agreement.<br />8.9.	In the event the Customer makes a claim under warranty provisions of this Agreement, the Customer's obligation to make all due payments under this Agreement remains unaffected. The Customer shall not withhold, reduce, or set-off payments due to the Systems Integrator while a warranty claim is being assessed, processed, or resolved. All payments for Products and Services provided under this Agreement shall continue to be payable in full and on the due date, irrespective of any warranty claim.<br />8.10.	The Systems Integrator reserves the right to review and assess the creditworthiness and financial condition of the Customer at any time during the term of this Agreement. This may include conducting credit checks, obtaining financial information, and monitoring the Customer's payment history.<br />8.10.1.	In the event that adverse activity is detected, including but not limited to a deterioration in the Customer's creditworthiness, a failure to meet payment obligations including payment due to third parties, litigation or any other indication of financial instability, the Systems Integrator may, at its discretion, modify, revoke, or impose additional conditions on the credit terms previously agreed upon.<br />8.10.2.	The Systems Integrator shall provide written notice to the Customer of any changes to the credit terms, including any modifications, revocations, or additional conditions. The notice shall specify the reasons for the changes and the effective date of the revised credit terms.<br />8.10.3.	In the instance of any alteration, rescission, or introduction of supplementary stipulations to the credit terms, the Systems Integrator holds the discretion to demand settlement of all outstanding dues and mandate immediate remittance of the total outstanding balance. However, notwithstanding such changes to the credit terms, the Customer may continue to leverage the credit terms, conditional upon the provision of an irrevocable bank guarantee from a reputable financial institution. The Customer is obligated to comply with the modified credit terms as communicated by the Systems Integrator. Failure to abide by these adjusted credit terms may precipitate the cessation of further credit extension or provoke the Systems Integrator to undertake other appropriate actions.<br />8.10.4.	The Customer acknowledges and agrees that the Systems Integrator's assessment of creditworthiness and financial condition is an ongoing process, and the Systems Integrator may periodically review and reassess the credit terms throughout the duration of this Agreement.<br />8.10.5.	The Systems Integrator shall not be liable for any losses, damages, or claims arising from the modification, revocation, or imposition of additional conditions on the credit terms, unless such liability arises from the Systems Integrator's negligence or breach of applicable laws.<br />8.10.6.	The provisions of this clause shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement, to the extent necessary to give effect to its terms and purposes.<br />9.	CHANGE CONTROL PROCEDURE<br />9.1.	In the event that either Party seeks to modify the scope or performance of the Services or Products ("Change Request"), such Party shall submit a written request to the other Party outlining the intended changes. The Party receiving the Change Request shall undertake a review of the proposal and shall respond in writing within a reasonable timeframe, not to exceed fifteen (15) Business Days. This response shall delineate the impact of the proposed alterations on the costs, timelines, or other aspects pertinent to the Agreement. The terms of the Agreement shall remain unaltered until both Parties have provided written consent to the proposed changes and the corresponding adjustments to the Agreement's stipulations. Any changes that are mutually agreed upon shall result in an addendum that outlines these revisions. This addendum shall be executed by both Parties and shall form an integral part of the Agreement.<br />10.	RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PARTIES<br />10.1.	This Agreement shall not be interpreted or construed to create an association, joint venture or partnership between the Parties or to impose any partnership obligation or liability upon any party.<br />10.2.	Each Party shall be responsible for the management, direction and control of its employees and sub-contractors and such employees and sub-contractors shall not be deemed to be employees or sub-contractors of the other Party.<br />11.	SUB-CONTRACTING<br />11.1.	The Systems Integrator reserves the right to sub-contract any or all obligations under this Agreement to third parties, including but not limited to manufacturers, vendors, other suitable entities, or Affiliated Companies. Despite any such sub-contracting arrangements, the Systems Integrator remains the principal entity accountable for all duties and obligations stipulated within this Agreement.<br />11.2.	The Systems Integrator ensures that any sub-contractor, including any Affiliated Companies, will be suitably qualified and competent to carry out the tasks assigned in full accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Should there be a breach of this Agreement caused by any sub-contractor or Affiliated Company, such breach will be deemed as a breach by the Systems Integrator, and the Systems Integrator will be held accountable accordingly.<br />12.	NON-SOLICITATION<br />12.1.	The Parties agree that they shall not, during the term of this Agreement, and for a period of two (2) years thereafter, recruit or request services from employees of the other Party without the prior written consent of the other Party. In the event that a Party wishes to recruit or engage the services of any of the other Party’s employees, it may do so by notifying the other Party in writing with the soliciting Party agreeing to pay an engagement fee of two hundred and fifty thousand euro (€250,000) excluding VAT, per employee, to the other Party, unless both Parties agree in writing to waive this clause.<br />13.	FORCE MAJEURE<br />13.1.	No liability shall be incurred by either Party towards the other Party for any breach of the Agreement that arises due to a Force Majeure Event, given that the Party not affected is satisfied that the Affected Party has taken all reasonable steps to mitigate the effects of the Force Majeure Event. In such cases, the obligations of the Affected Party under this Agreement that are prevented, hindered, or delayed by the Force Majeure Event are suspended for the duration of the event, and the Affected Party is granted a reasonable extension of time to perform such obligations.<br />13.2.	In the event of a Force Majeure Event, the Affected Party shall provide prompt written notice to the other Party, detailing the nature of the event, the anticipated duration of the delay, and the reasonable steps being taken to mitigate the impact of the event.<br />13.3.	The Affected Party shall use reasonable efforts to mitigate the effects of the event and resume the performance of its obligations as soon as reasonably practicable.<br />13.4.	If a Force Majeure Event continues for a period of one hundred and eighty (180) days or more, either Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement, without any liability or obligation other than for payment for the Products or Services delivered up to the date of termination, such date being no earlier than when the written notice was given to the other Party.<br />13.5.	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, a Force Majeure Event shall not relieve the Customer from the obligation to make payments for any Products or Services already delivered by the Systems Integrator prior to the occurrence of the Force Majeure Event.<br />13.6.	During the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, the Parties shall consult and cooperate in good faith to determine the best course of action to minimize the impact of the event on the performance of this Agreement.<br />13.7.	In the event that the Systems Integrator provides credit terms or payment plans exceeding thirty (30) days, the Customer shall be obliged to take out appropriate insurance coverage to mitigate the potential risks associated with Force Majeure events. The Customer shall make commercially reasonable efforts to obtain insurance coverage that adequately covers its obligations under this Agreement in the event of Force Majeure risks. The insurance coverage should aim to provide protection against all reasonably foreseeable risks and be obtained from reputable insurance providers. The Customer shall promptly provide the Systems Integrator with proof of insurance coverage upon request.<br />13.8.	The Systems Integrator reserves the right to review and adjust the credit terms offered to the Customer in light of any Force Majeure events or changes in the Customer's insurance coverage. The Parties shall engage in good faith discussions to address any necessary adjustments to credit terms, taking into consideration the risks associated with Force Majeure events.<br />14.	PRODUCT WARRANTY<br />14.1.	Unless otherwise explicitly stated in the Sales Order or the Proposal attached thereto, the Systems Integrator provides a limited warranty for the Products, commencing from the date of delivery and lasting for a period of seven (7) days. It is expressly acknowledged that the Systems Integrator does not provide any warranty, whether express or implied, with respect to the Software products. Any warranty claims pertaining to the Software products shall be the sole responsibility of the respective Vendors, and the Systems Integrator assumes no liability or obligation in relation thereto.<br />14.2.	During the warranty period, the Systems Integrator warrants that the Hardware will be free from material defects in material and workmanship under normal use and service, provided that the Customer fulfils its obligations as outlined herein. The warranty is extended solely to the original Customer and is non-transferable.<br />14.3.	The warranty covers any malfunction or failure of the Hardware resulting from manufacturing defects, faulty workmanship, or non-conformity to the manufacturer's or vendor's specifications. In the event of such a defect, the Systems Integrator or the manufacturer, at their discretion, will provide appropriate remedies, which may include repair, replacement, or refund of the defective Hardware. The warranty specifically excludes the following:<br />14.3.1.	Damage or defects resulting from improper installation, use, handling, or storage of the Hardware by the Customer;<br />14.3.2.	Any modifications, alterations, or repairs made to the Hardware by parties other than the Systems Integrator or authorized service providers;<br />14.3.3.	Normal wear and tear, including but not limited to cosmetic damages, scratches, or dents that do not affect the functionality of the Hardware;<br />14.3.4.	Damage caused by accidents, negligence, misuse, abuse, or acts beyond the Systems Integrator's control, including but not limited to fire, flood, power surges, or electrical disturbances;<br />14.3.5.	Compatibility issues arising from the Customer's use of the Hardware in conjunction with other hardware, software, or peripherals not recommended or approved by the manufacturer; and<br />14.3.6.	Loss of data, software, or other digital content stored on the Hardware.<br />14.4.	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the warranty period for the Hardware that include batteries, is limited to seven (7) days by default and ninety (90) days maximum irrespective of any warranty period specified in the Sales Order or the Proposal attached to the Sales Order or the product’s standard warranty duration. Therefore, if for example, the product is offered a two-year warranty period, the warranty period on the battery component is nevertheless limited to ninety (90) days.<br />14.5.	The Customer shall be responsible for maintaining all-risk insurance coverage for the Products while they are being repaired under this warranty. The Systems Integrator shall not be held liable for any damage or loss to the Products that occurs during this period.<br />14.6.	The Systems Integrator shall not be responsible for the loss of any data stored on the Products. The Customer is advised to back up all data before returning any Product for repair.<br />14.7.	The Systems Integrator shall not be responsible for any loss of business or other consequential damages arising from the use, misuse, or inability to use the Products.<br />14.8.	The Systems Integrator is under no obligation to provide any courtesy replacement equipment while the Customer's Hardware is being repaired unless otherwise stated in the Sales Order or the Proposal attached to the Sales Order.<br />14.9.	The Systems Integrator does not guarantee a specific timeframe for the provision of replacement parts or the completion of repairs, unless otherwise specified in the Sales Order or the proposal attached to the Sales Order.<br />14.10.	The Systems Integrator relies on the warranties provided by the Vendors of the Products. In cases where the warranty is not offered directly between the Customer and the Vendor, the Systems Integrator will make a claim to the Vendor on behalf of the Customer. It is the Vendor who decides what remediation is necessary and what the Customer is entitled to under the Vendor's warranty. The Systems Integrator does not independently provide any warranties and all warranty claims are subject to the terms and conditions of the Vendor's warranty. It is the responsibility of the Customer to familiarize themselves with the terms and conditions of the Vendor's warranty prior to making a purchase.<br />14.11.	Any replacement parts provided under this warranty may be new or refurbished, at the discretion of the Vendor.<br />14.12.	In the event of a Parts-Only Warranty, the parts shall be made available for collection by the Customer at a location established by the Systems Integrator. Alternatively, the parts may be shipped or delivered to the Customer, with all shipping or delivery costs and taxes to be borne by the Customer.<br />14.13.	In the case of Products that are sold with a direct Vendor support contract or warranty, the warranty will be provided directly by the Vendor. In such case, the Customer acknowledges and agrees that it will need to interact directly with the Vendor for the purposes of warranty claims and support. The Systems Integrator does not provide any additional or separate warranty for these Products.<br />14.14.	The Customer agrees and acknowledges that the decision of the Vendor with regard to warranty claims is final. The Systems Integrator shall not be responsible for and will not have any obligations with respect to the decisions made by the Vendor regarding the warranty claims.<br />14.15.	The Systems Integrator's liability for any defective Product is limited to the repair or replacement of the Product or the refund of the purchase price, at the Systems Integrator's option. The Systems Integrator will not be liable for any other damages or losses, including, but not limited to, loss of use, loss of profits, or loss of data, whether in an action in contract or tort or based on a warranty, arising out of or in connection with any use of the Product.<br />14.16.	Unless otherwise specified in the Sales Order or the Proposal attached to the Sales Order, all warranties offered are on a "return to base" basis. The costs for transportation of the Products to and from the base for the purposes of warranty repairs are to be borne by the Customer. The Systems Integrator may, at its discretion, facilitate transportation to and from the base. A quote for such transportation services will be provided to the Customer in advance, and such services will be provided only upon the Customer's acceptance of the quote for the transportation fees.<br />14.17.	The warranties under this Agreement do not extend to any Software elements, including but not limited to, software applications, drivers, operating systems, and firmware, regardless of whether they are included with the Product or installed subsequently. This includes issues stemming from the compatibility of the Products with other hardware or software components, systems, or configurations used by the Customer, for which the Systems Integrator bears no responsibility. Moreover, the sale of software products, licensing, or use entitlements by the Systems Integrator comes without warranties, performance guarantees, or any other form of assurance, except as expressly outlined in the applicable software license agreement or any other agreement between the Customer and the software vendor/manufacturer. Any disputes related to software products, licensing, or use entitlements shall be handled directly between the Customer and the Vendor, with the Systems Integrator bearing no responsibility for such disputes. The Systems Integrator is deemed to have fulfilled its obligations under this Agreement upon making any license key or equivalent, or access to such keys, available to the Customer in accordance with the Sales Order or the Proposal attached to the Sales Order.<br />14.18.	The sale of Software, Licenses, or use entitlements by the Systems Integrator shall be without warranties, performance guarantees, or any other form of assurance, except as expressly set forth in the applicable software license agreement or other agreement between the Customer and the vendor. The Customer acknowledges that any disputes related to software products, licensing, or use entitlements shall be managed directly between the Customer and the Vendor, and the Systems Integrator shall not be responsible for any such disputes. The Systems Integrator shall be deemed to have fulfilled its obligations under this Agreement once any license key or equivalent, or access to such keys, is made available to the Customer in accordance with the Sales Order or the Proposal attached to the Sales Order.<br />14.19.	In the event of a breach of these warranty provisions by the Systems Integrator, the Systems Integrator's sole liability and the Customer's exclusive remedy will be, at the Systems Integrator's option, to repair or replace the defective Product or refund the purchase price for the defective Product.<br />14.20.	Except for the warranty set forth in this section, the Systems Integrator disclaims all other warranties, whether express or implied, including without limitation, any implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, to the maximum extent permitted by law.<br />15.	HARDWARE REPAIR – SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLAs)<br />15.1.	By default, the Systems Integrator provides Hardware repair services on a best effort basis. The Systems Integrator will use reasonable efforts to repair the Hardware as quickly as possible, but does not guarantee a specific timeframe for the completion of repairs.<br />15.2.	If the Systems Integrator is offering a specific SLA for Hardware repair to the Customer, this will be explicitly specified in the Sales Order or the Proposal attached to the Sales Order. The terms of such SLA, including the guaranteed response or repair times, will be set out in the Sales Order or the Proposal attached to the Sales Order.<br />15.3.	The SLAs for Hardware repair are applicable only to the repair of Hardware components of the Products. They do not cover any Software elements, including but not limited to, firmware, software applications, drivers, or operating systems, whether included with the Product or installed subsequently.<br />15.4.	The SLAs do not cover issues arising from the compatibility of the Products with other hardware or software components, systems, or configurations used by the Customer. The Systems Integrator is not responsible for ensuring compatibility between the Products and any other hardware or software used by the Customer.<br />16.	PROFESSIONAL SERVICES – SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLAs)<br />16.1.	Pursuant to standard operational procedure, the Systems Integrator furnishes Professional Services grounded in a principle of best effort, employing reasonable measures to respond to service requests in a timely manner without, however, proffering a definitive timeframe for such response.<br />16.2.

These Professional Services may include offerings designed to monitor, optimise and secure the Customer's technological framework.<br />19.2.

This individual will serve as the Systems Integrator's principal point of communication and collaboration with the Customer. The Customer shall communicate the details of the Key Contact Person via email to enterprisesupport@fonicom.com and notices@fonicom.com.<br />19.3.	The Key Contact Person will be accountable for the oversight of all service requests that fall under this agreement on behalf of the Customer, which could encompass Technical Support Requests, Service Requests, Change Requests, Warranty Requests, or Incident Requests. They will be responsible for providing comprehensive information pertinent to the understanding, diagnosis, and remediation of issues.<br />19.4.

As such, the Systems Integrator will not be held liable for any delay, failure, or deficiency in the provision of the Managed Services that results from the unavailability or unresponsiveness of the Key Contact Person or other technical resources from the Customer's side.<br />20.

Delay in delivery will not entitle the Customer to cancel the order unless the delay exceeds ninety (90) Business Days.<br />20.2.

The Customer shall be deemed to have accepted the Hardware unless the Customer notifies the Systems Integrator in writing of any non-conformity within three (3) days from receipt.

The Customer’s representative shall sign the Delivery Note to confirm receipt of the goods, and such signature shall constitute acceptance of the goods. <br />20.5.	If the Parties have entered into a separate services agreement for a specific project, the acceptance of services for that project shall be governed by the terms of that agreement. If no separate services agreement is in force, the Customer shall be deemed to have accepted the Professional Services upon receipt of the invoice unless the Customer notifies the Systems Integrator in writing of any non-conformity within three (3) days from the date of delivery of the invoice. If the Customer notifies the Systems Integrator of any non-conformity within the three (3) day period, the Systems Integrator shall have the opportunity to cure any non-conformity by re-performing the Professional Services, as applicable.<br />20.6.

Answer =>  Based on the context provided, I did not find any provisions in this Sales Agreement that directly contradict or violate the Civil Code of Malta. The agreement appears to be a standard commercial contract governing the sale of products and services between the Systems Integrator (Fonicom) and the Customer.

However, it's important to note that my analysis is limited to the excerpts provided, and I cannot definitively confirm compliance with all aspects of Maltese law without reviewing the complete agreement and relevant legal provisions. Additionally, as an AI system, I cannot provide legal advice or make definitive determinations regarding the legality of contractual clauses.

If you have specific concerns about the legality or enforceability of any provisions in this agreement, I would recommend consulting with a qualified legal professional who can review the agreement in its entirety and provide a comprehensive assessment based on their expertise in Maltese contract law.

F’dan ir-rigward, l-Atturi presentaw il-kuntratti talbejgħ mill-bidu sakemm waslet għand Mark Borda u dawn huma:<br />1. Kuntratt ta’ bejgħ datat 29 ta’ Awwissu 1989 bejn M. and S.<br />Developers Limited flimkien ma’ Genco General Commercial and<br />Industrial Enterprises li biegħu lil Joseph Debono, fl-atti tan-Nutar Victor<br />John Bisazza, (a fol. 99 sa 116 u a fol. 117 sa 132 u a fol. 194 sa 196).<br />F’dan il-kuntratt insibu illi “the said pent house flat having in common<br />with the other apartments in the said Block, the ownership of the<br />entrance to the Block, Hallway, stairs, stairwell, staircase, lift, lift space,<br />shafts and landings.” Inoltre’ sa frjn jirrigwarda l-arja ta’ fuq il-penthouse<br />jipprovdi illi “The ownership of the roof of the Block and the said Pent<br />House flat, including relative airspace of both, is also being transferred to<br />the Purchaser, however the roof of the Pent house Flat shall retain on it<br />the water tanks (one for each flat including the Pent house Flat) and a<br />Comunal Television Aerial.

Pero’ dan il-ftehim ma jistax imur kontra l-kuntratti hawn<br />fuq kollha imsemmija li kollha jindikaw b’mod ċar li s-sid tal-penthouse<br />dejjem għandu d-dritt illi jibni sulari oħrajn, bid-dritt tal-użu għas-sidien<br />tal-appartamenti l-oħra.<br />Li kieku l-ladies cleaning room hi komuni bejn is-sidien kollha allura s-sid<br />tal-penthouse ma seta’ qatt jingħata d-dritt li jaqbad u jibni sular ieħor<br />mingħajr il-permess tas-sidien l-oħra, u f’ebda wiehed mill-kuntratti talAtturi ma hemm xi klwasola li tipprojbixxi dan, liema klawsola ma<br />tissemma’ fl-ebda kuntratt hawn fuq imsemmi. Li kieku tali din il-ladies<br />cleaning room kellha tkun komuni, din kienet tkun imsemmija fil-kuntratt<br />bħal ma ssemma’ il-lift shaft, fost oħrajn.<br />2. Bil-kuntratt datat 10 ta’ Diċembru 1996 fl-atti tan-Nutar Dr. Pierre<br />Cassar, u liema kopja tinsab a fol. 190 sa 19, Joseph Debono biegħ limsemmija penthouse lil Mark Borda li hija nnumerata 15 fil-blokka talappartamenti hawn fuq imsemmija.

Evidenza oħra fil-proċess<br />Apparti l-kuntratti hekk ippreżentati, din il-Qorti wkoll qieset ukoll il-provi loħra kollha li ma humiex ta’ natura dokumentali.<br />a. L-affidavit tar-rikorrenti Victor Sant<br />Victor Sant, fl-affidavit tiegħu tat-23 ta’ April 2019, jgħid illi “din il-kamra<br />tas-seftura inbniet mal-blokka ta’ appartamenti in kwistjoni”. Il-Qorti<br />tifhem illi ġjaladarba l-arja hija sovraposta ghall-penthouse, din il-kamra<br />ma setgħet qatt inbniet mingħar il-kunsens ta’ sid il-penthouse. Dan ilkunsens ma jirrisulta minn imkien. Victor Sant reġa’ xehed fl-14 ta’<br />Diċembru 2021, u għid illi hu xtara qabel Joseph Debono (a’ fol 376 sa<br />383). Jiftakar il-kamra tas-seftura mibnija. Pero’ fil-kuntratt tiegħu ma<br />hemm ebda referenza għal din il-kamra. Din il-Qorti hi konvinta illi li kieku<br />kien dan il-każ, Victor Sant kien ikun ċert li din il-kamra kienet tissemma’<br />bħala li tagħmel parti mill-partijiet l-oħra li jiffurmaw il-komun.<br />Rik. Nru. 266/19TA<br />29<br />Ġaladarba li l-Atturi qegħdin jinsistu li din il-kamra tagħmel parti millpartijiet kommuni huwa interessanti li wieħed iħares lejn id-definizzjoni ta’<br />x’inhuma prtijiet komuni skond art 5 tal-Kap 398 :<br />“Kemm-il darba ma jirriżultax xort’oħra mit-titolu tas-sidien tal-oqsma<br />separati, jew sakemm ma jkunx hemm qbil mod ieħor bejn il-condomini<br />b’att pubbliku, il-partijiet komuni ta’ condominium huma dawn li ġejjin,<br />ukoll jekk wieħed jew iżjed mill-condomini ma jagħmilx użu minnu:<br />(a) l-art li fuqha jkun mibni l-condominium, il-pedamenti,il-ħitan ta’ barra,<br />inklużi l-ħitan diviżorji komuni mal-fondi ta’ biswit, is-soqfa, ix-xaftijiet, ittaraġ, il-bibien ta’ dħul komuni, intrati, trombi tat-taraġ, btieħi, ġonna, l-arja<br />li tiġi fuq il-proprjetà kollha u b’mod ġenerali, kull parti oħra tal-proprjetà li<br />għandha għan li tintuża b’mod komuni;<br />(b) il-partijiet li jintużaw bħala intrata u bħala kamra tal-ħasil komuni u lpartijiet li jintużaw bħala porter’s, għat-tagħmir ta’ central heating, u għal<br />kull faċilità oħra li għandha għan li tintuża b’mod komuni;<br />U<br />(ċ) id-dwal, bjar, tankijiet, akwedotti, drenaġġi, pajpijiet tal-katusi tal-ilma,<br />kull stallazzjoni għall-ilma, gass,elettriku, tisħin u servizzi oħra simili sa<br />fejn dawk l-istallazzjonijiet jaqsmu lejn il-proprjetà esklużiva ta’ kull<br />condominus, u kull opra, stallazzjoni u oġġett ta’ kull għamla li tkun li<br />Rik.

Din iċ-ċirkostanza torbot ma’ dak li<br />xehed Joseph Debono meta xehed illi bnieha hu din il-kamra wara li xtara<br />l-penthouse u li bnieha fil-fatt fuq in-naħa l-oħra tal-bejt li ma hux milqut ilftehim imsemmi (a’ fol. 321 sa 327 ara ukoll a fol. 340 sa 343).<br />Xehed ukoll Philip Tabone fit-2 ta’ Mejju 2022, a fol. 391 sa 399 li qal ċar<br />u tond li, għalkemm huwa kien wieħed li bena din il-blokka ta’<br />appartamenti, ma jiftakarx kienx hemm din il-kamra tas-seftura fuq il-bejt.<br />Qal ukoll illi m’għandux aċċess għall-imsemmija kamra u huwa biss Mark<br />Borda illi għandu aċċess (a’ fol 391 sa 399).<br />Mill-permessi relattivi tal-bini jirrisulta li setghet tinbena pent house iżda<br />ma setgħetx tinbena washroom fuq il-pent house li jinsabu fosthom a fol.<br />423 u 424). Insibu ittra datata 23 ta’ Mejju 1989, u ċioe’ qabel ma xtara lpenthouse Joseph Debono. Il-Perit Sebastian Grima, illi jiġi n-neputi talPerit Italo Raniolo, li kien il-Perit tal-blokka xehed illi mid-dokumentazzjoni<br />jidher illi l-penthouse ma kinitx mibnija qabel it-23 ta’ Mejju 1989 (a’ fol.<br />448 sa 452). Dan il-fatt ikompli jaghti affidament għax-xhieda talkonvenut Borda peress li xtara wara dik id-data u preċiżament fl-10 ta’<br />Diċembru 1996.<br />Inoltre’ Genco, General Commercial and Industrial Enterprises Limited (C<br />2819), li kienet waħda mill-iżvilluppaturi tal-imsemmija blokka wkoll tinsisti<br />illi din il-kamra tas-seftura hi ta’ l-intimat Mark Borda, u dan skond in-nota<br />Rik.

Answer =>  Based on the extensive review of the court case provided, it appears that the primary issue revolves around the ownership and rights associated with a room referred to as the "ladies cleaning room" located on the roof level of a block of apartments known as Tower Point Mansions in Sliema. The applicants (rikorrenti) are contesting that this room should be considered a common part of the property, accessible to all apartment owners, while the respondent (intimat), Mark Borda, claims it as his property, being part of the penthouse airspace he owns.

The court must consider the evidence presented, including the affidavits, testimonies, and the original contracts of sale (kuntratti ta' bejgħ) for the apartments and the penthouse. The contracts seem to indicate that the roof space over the penthouse, which includes the "ladies cleaning room," is the property of the penthouse owner and not a common area shared by all apartment owners. This is supported by the fact that the contracts for the apartments do not specifically mention the "ladies cleaning room" as a common area, and the airspace above the penthouse is explicitly stated as belonging to the penthouse owner.

Furthermore, the court has considered the affidavits and testimonies of various parties, including Victor Sant and Austin Demajo, as well as the observations made by the court during an on-site visit. The evidence suggests that the "ladies cleaning room" has been exclusively used and maintained by Mark Borda for a significant period, further supporting his claim to the property.

Given the information presented, the court's decision should reflect the findings that the "ladies cleaning room" is indeed the property of the penthouse owner, Mark Borda, and not a common area. Consequently, the court should uphold Borda's rights to the room and deny the applicants' claims to access and keys to the room. The court should also address the reconventional claims (talbiet rikonvenzjonali) made by Borda, granting or denying them based on the established ownership of the "ladies cleaning room" and the rights outlined in the respective contracts.

The court's decision should be detailed, providing clear reasoning for each point of contention and the basis for the ruling on each claim and reconventional claim, taking into account the legal principles and evidence presented in the case.

Query =>  what taxes are due when a company dealing in property sells a property?
Answer =>  When a company dealing in property sells a property in Malta, several taxes may be due, depending on the specific circumstances of the sale. The primary taxes to consider are:

1. Provisional Tax: According to Article 43 of the Income Tax Act (Cap. 123), when a person (which includes a company) makes a transfer of property, they are required to remit a provisional tax payment to the Commissioner for Revenue. This payment is generally equivalent to 7% of the higher of the market value and the consideration for the transfer. This provisional tax payment must be made within fifteen days of the transfer.

2. Final Tax: The provisional tax paid may be adjusted when the final tax is calculated on the actual gains or profits derived from the transfer. The final tax rate will depend on the specific provisions of the Income Tax Act that apply to the transaction.

3. Additional Duty: If the company selling the property is a property company (as defined in the Income Tax Act), which holds directly or indirectly shares in another company with 75% or more of its assets consisting of immovable property (excluding current assets other than immovable property), an additional duty may be due. This duty is increased by three euro for every one hundred euro or part thereof of the amount or value of the consideration or the real value of the marketable security, whichever is the higher.

It is important to note that there are specific exemptions and different rates that may apply under certain conditions, such as transfers of property that are not subject to tax under the provisions of articles 5 and 12 of the Income Tax Act, or in the case of transfers to which article 5(9A) or 27G of the Income Tax Act applies.

For accurate calculation and remittance of taxes due on the sale of property by a company, it is essential to consider the relevant provisions of the Income Tax Act and any other applicable rules or regulations.

Query =>  what taxes are applicable to transfer or property from the sellers side
Answer =>  According to Maltese Company Law, specifically the Income Tax Act (Cap. 123), there are taxes applicable to the transfer of property from the seller's side. The tax rate depends on various factors. For transfers made on or after November 1, 2005, the tax rate is generally 8% of the transfer value. However, there are exceptions and different rates for specific situations.

If the transfer is a transfer of property that was acquired by the seller through a transfer causa mortis (inheritance) after November 24, 1992, or through a donation made more than five years before the transfer, the tax rate is 12% of the excess of the transfer value over its acquisition value.

It's important to note that if the property transferred consists of a property forming part of a project, the 12% tax rate does not apply. Additionally, the transferor can elect to apply a different tax rate by making a declaration to the notary at the time of the transfer deed's publication.

For transfers of property acquired through a donation made five years or less before the transfer, the tax rate is determined based on specific provisions.

It's crucial to consult with a legal professional or tax advisor for specific advice tailored to your situation.

Query =>  i own a plot of land. the previous owner is stating that part of the land what not transferred, but the site plans clearly indicate it was. He is threathing to erect a wall to split the boundary. What remedies do i have to stop him
Answer =>  Based on the information provided in the Civil Code of Malta, if you own a plot of land and the previous owner is claiming that part of the land was not transferred to you, despite the site plans indicating otherwise, you have certain legal rights and remedies to address the situation.

Firstly, you have the right to compel your neighbor to fix the boundaries of your adjoining tenements at joint expense, as stated in Article 325 of the Civil Code: "Every owner may compel his neighbour to fix, at joint expense, by visible and permanent marks, the boundaries of their adjoining tenements."

If the previous owner is threatening to erect a wall on what you believe to be your property, you may also invoke your rights under Article 326, which states that "Every owner may enclose his tenement, saving any right of easement to which other parties may be entitled." This means that you have the right to enclose your property, but you must also respect any established easements.

Furthermore, if the previous owner proceeds with the construction without your consent and it affects your property, you may have recourse under Article 419, which outlines that it is not lawful for one neighbor to cause any new work to be affixed to or to lean against a common wall without the consent of the other neighbor, or without having first determined by means of experts the necessary measures to be taken to prevent the new work from injuriously affecting the rights of the other neighbor.

In the event of a dispute over the boundary, you may need to seek a determination by experts or the courts to establish the correct boundary line based on the site plans and any other relevant documentation.

It is important to note that these provisions are designed to ensure that the rights of property owners are respected and that any disputes are resolved in a manner that is fair and legal. If the previous owner proceeds with the construction of a wall without proper legal basis or without respecting your rights as the current owner, you may need to take legal action to enforce your rights and prevent any unlawful encroachment on your property.

Query =>  is there cause for a criminal complaint?
Answer =>  In the context of Maltese Company Law, the situation you described regarding the previous owner threatening to erect a wall to split the boundary of your land does not inherently constitute a criminal matter. Criminal complaints typically involve actions that are considered offenses against the state or public order. 

However, if the previous owner's actions amount to a specific criminal offense under Maltese law, such as trespassing or willful damage to property, you may have grounds for a criminal complaint. For instance, if the previous owner enters your property without permission and starts construction, this could potentially be considered trespassing. Similarly, if the previous owner damages your property in the process, this could be considered willful damage.

Under the Criminal Code [CAP. 9], Article 339, trespassing is defined as "Whosoever, without any lawful cause, shall enter into any dwelling-house, or into the offices, out-houses, or enclosed yards, gardens or grounds thereto attached, or into any closed or fenced immovable property, or shall be found therein, after having been warned to depart therefrom, shall, on conviction, be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months or to a fine (multa)."

If the previous owner's actions do not fall under a specific criminal offense, the matter would likely be considered a civil dispute, which would be handled through civil litigation rather than criminal proceedings.

It is important to consult the specific provisions of the Criminal Code and other relevant laws to determine whether the actions of the previous owner constitute a criminal offense. If you believe that a criminal offense has been committed, you may report the matter to the police for further investigation.

Query =>  can i have an employment agreement, wherin, a bonus and salary level is contingent on the employee staying on with the company for a period of 5 years. so for example if the employee leaves after 2 years he will have to pay back the bonus and 50% of the salary
Answer =>  In Maltese Company Law, it is permissible to have employment agreements that include conditions related to bonuses and salary levels contingent on the employee remaining with the company for a specified period. Such clauses are generally known as 'golden handcuffs' and are designed to retain key employees. However, the enforceability of these clauses must be consistent with Maltese employment law, particularly with regard to the protection of employees' rights.

Regarding the repayment of bonuses, it is possible to include a clause in the employment agreement that requires the repayment of bonuses if the employee leaves before a certain period. This is often structured as a form of deferred compensation or conditional bonus, where the employee's right to the bonus vests over time.

As for the salary, requiring an employee to pay back a portion of their salary upon leaving the company before a certain time may be more complex. Under Maltese law, the wage is considered the basic entitlement for work performed, and clauses that infringe upon the right to receive wages for work done may be viewed as potentially unfair or penal in nature and could be subject to scrutiny by the courts or employment tribunals.

It is important to note that any such clauses should be clearly stated in the employment contract, and the employee should be fully aware of these conditions before entering into the agreement. The terms should be reasonable, and not so onerous as to effectively trap an employee in employment against their will or create an undue financial burden upon leaving.

In the context of Maltese law, the Employment and Industrial Relations Act (CAP. 452) provides for the protection of wages and outlines the conditions under which an employer may make deductions from wages. Any agreement that contravenes the provisions of this Act, particularly those that protect the payment of wages, may be considered null and void.

Therefore, while certain conditions related to bonuses may be enforceable, the idea of requiring an employee to pay back 50% of their salary may not be enforceable under Maltese law, as it could be seen as a penalty that infringes upon the employee's right to wages earned for work performed.

It is advisable to carefully draft such clauses to ensure they comply with Maltese employment law and to consider the potential implications of enforcing such terms. Employers should also be mindful of the balance between creating incentives for employees to stay and potentially creating a disincentive for potential employees who may view such terms as overly restrictive.

Query =>  the idea is this. This employee will be running a business unit. the business unit will require substantial investment. the employee will have a bonus tied on the performance of the unit. They employee is a key person, therefore if he leaves before 5 years it will render the investment null. how do I go about it, give me ideas
Answer =>  In Maltese Company Law, to protect the company's investment in a business unit that is heavily reliant on a key employee, you can consider several strategies within the employment agreement to incentivize the employee to stay for the desired period:

1. **Performance Bonus Structure**: You can design a performance-based bonus structure that rewards the employee incrementally over the five-year period. For example, a portion of the bonus could be allocated for each year of service, with the amount increasing each year to encourage retention. This way, the bonus becomes fully vested at the end of the five-year period, providing a strong financial incentive for the employee to remain with the company.

2. **Long-term Incentive Plans (LTIPs)**: Consider implementing LTIPs such as stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs), or other equity-based incentives that vest over the five-year period. These plans give the employee a stake in the company's future success, aligning their interests with the company's long-term performance.

3. **Deferred Compensation**: You can set up a deferred compensation plan where a portion of the employee's salary or bonus is deferred and paid out at the end of the five-year period. This deferred amount acts as a retention tool, as the employee would forfeit this compensation if they leave before the end of the term.

4. **Clawback Provisions**: Include clawback provisions in the employment agreement that allow the company to reclaim a portion of the bonuses paid if the employee leaves before the five-year period. These provisions must be carefully drafted to ensure they are enforceable and do not contravene any employment protections under Maltese law.

5. **Non-compete and Non-solicitation Clauses**: Incorporate non-compete and non-solicitation clauses that restrict the employee from joining competitors or soliciting clients and staff for a certain period after leaving the company. These clauses can protect the company's investment by limiting the employee's ability to immediately work for a competitor.

6. **Tailored Training and Development**: Offer a personalized training and development program that spans the five-year period. This investment in the employee's professional growth can increase their loyalty and commitment to the company.

7. **Clear Communication of Expectations**: Ensure that the terms of the employment agreement, especially those related to the investment in the business unit and the importance of the employee's role, are clearly communicated and understood. This transparency can foster a sense of responsibility and commitment.

It is crucial that any terms included in the employment agreement comply with Maltese employment law and are reasonable, clear, and agreed upon by both parties. The agreement should not impose undue hardship on the employee or be seen as a penalty for leaving the company. Instead, it should provide fair compensation and incentives that align the employee's interests with the long-term success of the business unit and the company as a whole.

Remember, while these strategies can be effective, they must be balanced with the need to maintain a positive working relationship and a supportive work environment. High employee turnover can often be mitigated by fostering a culture that values and rewards loyalty and long-term commitment.

Query =>  check the legality of all of the 6 points above in detail
Answer =>  I apologize for any confusion, but as an AI developed to provide information on Maltese Company Law, I must clarify that the previous responses provided were not based on specific provisions from Maltese Company Law. The strategies mentioned, such as performance bonus structures, long-term incentive plans, deferred compensation, clawback provisions, non-compete and non-solicitation clauses, and tailored training and development, are general business practices that can be considered in employment agreements. However, their legality and enforceability would need to be assessed within the context of Maltese employment law, specifically the Employment and Industrial Relations Act (CAP. 452).

To address the legality of the points mentioned in detail:

1. **Performance Bonus Structure**: The legality of a performance bonus structure would depend on the specific terms and conditions set out in the employment contract. The Employment and Industrial Relations Act does not specifically prohibit performance-based bonuses, but any such bonus scheme must be fair, reasonable, and clearly communicated to the employee.

2. **Long-term Incentive Plans (LTIPs)**: LTIPs such as stock options or RSUs are not specifically addressed in the Employment and Industrial Relations Act. Their legality would depend on the specific terms of the incentive plan and its compliance with other relevant laws, such as the Companies Act and financial regulations.

3. **Deferred Compensation**: Deferred compensation plans are not specifically prohibited by Maltese law, but they must be structured in a way that does not infringe upon the employee's right to timely payment of wages as per the Employment and Industrial Relations Act.

4. **Clawback Provisions**: Clawback provisions can be included in employment contracts; however, they must be reasonable and not constitute a penalty. They should be designed to recover bonuses or other variable compensation, not fixed wages, and must be clearly communicated and agreed upon by the employee.

5. **Non-compete and Non-solicitation Clauses**: Such clauses are subject to limitations under Maltese law. They must be reasonable in terms of duration, geographical scope, and the type of work restricted. If deemed excessive, they may be considered unenforceable.

6. **Tailored Training and Development**: Offering training and development is generally legal and encouraged, but it cannot be used as a tool to unduly bind an employee to the company. Any obligations tied to training (e.g., repayment if the employee leaves early) must be reasonable and proportionate.

It is important to note that all terms of employment contracts must comply with the Employment and Industrial Relations Act (CAP. 452), which sets out the rights and obligations of employers and employees. Any clauses that are deemed unfair or contrary to the mandatory provisions of the Act may be considered null and void.

For specific legal provisions and detailed assessments of the legality of employment contract terms, it would be necessary to consult the Employment and Industrial Relations Act (CAP. 452) and other relevant legislation, as well as potentially seek legal advice to ensure compliance with Maltese law.

Answer =>  Based on the information provided, it appears that Excel Homes Real Estate Limited has filed a sworn application against Martin Pace and Mary Pace, claiming a debt of €37,465.00 for services rendered as a real estate agency. The company asserts that this amount is due for commission and VAT related to a property transaction, and despite official correspondence, the defendants have remained in default.

The defendants have raised several preliminary exceptions, including that Mary Pace was not a legitimate contradictor and should be released from the judgment immediately, as she did not sign any contract with the plaintiff company and was cited in the lawsuit vexatiously. They also claim that the contract in question is null due to being flawed in fact and in law, alleging that Martin Pace was under pressure when he signed it. Furthermore, they argue that the contract contains unfair terms prohibited by law, imposes disproportionately high compensation for the alleged service, binds the consumer with clauses that were not clearly understood before signing, and is incompatible with the requirements of the law regarding pre-contractual negotiations and mutual consent.

In light of these arguments, the court must consider the evidence presented by both parties, including the sworn application, the contract, and any official correspondence. The court must also assess the validity of the contract and whether it contains unfair terms as alleged by the defendants. The court will need to determine if the defendants have valid exceptions that can be raised in this case.

The decision of the court will depend on the application of relevant laws, including the Code of Organization and Civil Procedure (Chapter 12 of the Laws of Malta), which governs the procedures for such cases, and the Consumer Affairs Act (Chapter 378 of the Laws of Malta), which deals with unfair contract terms and practices.

The court will have to decide whether to hear the case summarily without a full hearing (dispensing with the hearing) as requested by the plaintiff, or whether the defendants' exceptions merit a full hearing. If the court finds the contract to be null or containing unfair terms, it may dismiss the plaintiff's claims. Conversely, if the court finds the contract to be valid and the debt to be due, it may order the defendants to pay the claimed amount, along with any applicable interest and costs.

The court's decision will be based on the interpretation of the law and the facts presented, ensuring that justice is served in accordance with Maltese law.

Answer =>  Based on the information provided in the excerpts, I cannot provide a definitive decision on this case, as that would require careful consideration of all evidence and arguments by the court. However, I can explain the relevant legal provisions and outline the key issues the court will need to assess:

1. Validity of the Contract:
The defendants have raised several exceptions challenging the validity of the contract between Excel Homes Real Estate Limited and Martin Pace. The court will need to examine if the contract is null or voidable due to any of the following grounds alleged by the defendants:

a) Lack of consent/undue influence (Article 974 of Civil Code): The defendants claim Martin Pace was under pressure when signing the contract, which could vitiate his free consent.

b) Unfair contract terms (Consumer Affairs Act, Chapter 378, Articles 44-47): The defendants argue the contract contains unfair, prohibited clauses like disproportionately high compensation, binding the consumer to unclear terms, and incompatibility with pre-contractual negotiation requirements.

If the court finds the contract to be null or containing unfair terms, it may declare the contract invalid or unenforceable.

2. Liability of Mary Pace:
The defendants claim Mary Pace should be released from the judgment as she did not sign the contract. The court will need to determine if she can be held liable based on the evidence and her relationship to the transaction.

3. Entitlement to Commission:
If the court upholds the validity of the contract, it will need to assess if Excel Homes Real Estate Limited is entitled to the claimed commission and VAT based on the services rendered and the terms of the contract.

Sources:
- Civil Code (Chapter 16 of the Laws of Malta) - Articles related to validity of contracts
- Consumer Affairs Act (Chapter 378 of the Laws of Malta) - Articles 44-47 on unfair contract terms

The court's decision will depend on its evaluation of the evidence, arguments, and application of the relevant laws. If the necessary information is not available in the provided excerpts, I cannot speculate further without risking providing inaccurate or unsupported information.

Query =>  what is the most likely outcome 
Answer =>  Based on the information provided in the excerpts, it is difficult to predict the most likely outcome with certainty. However, I can analyze the key factors that the court will likely consider and provide an assessment of the potential outcomes:

1. Validity of the Contract:
The defendants have raised strong arguments challenging the validity of the contract, alleging lack of consent due to undue pressure on Martin Pace, and the presence of unfair terms prohibited by the Consumer Affairs Act. If the court finds merit in these arguments, it may declare the contract null and void or unenforceable, which would likely result in the dismissal of the plaintiff's claims.

2. Liability of Mary Pace:
The defendants have argued that Mary Pace should be released from the judgment as she did not sign the contract. Unless the plaintiff can provide evidence of her direct involvement or liability, the court may release her from the case.

3. Entitlement to Commission:
If the court upholds the validity of the contract, it will need to assess whether the plaintiff is entitled to the claimed commission and VAT based on the services rendered and the terms of the contract. The court may award the claimed amount or a portion thereof if it finds the plaintiff's claims to be valid and supported by evidence.

Considering the arguments presented by both parties, the potential outcomes could be:

a) The court finds the contract to be null or containing unfair terms, leading to the dismissal of the plaintiff's claims against both defendants.

b) The court releases Mary Pace from the case but finds the contract to be valid and enforceable against Martin Pace, ordering him to pay the claimed amount or a portion thereof.

c) The court upholds the validity of the contract and orders both defendants to pay the claimed amount or a portion thereof.

Based on the defendants' arguments and the provisions of the Consumer Affairs Act, the most likely outcome appears to be either (a) or (b), where the court may find issues with the validity of the contract or release Mary Pace from liability. However, the final decision will depend on the court's assessment of the evidence, arguments, and application of the relevant laws.

It is important to note that without access to the complete evidence and legal arguments, any prediction of the outcome remains speculative. The court's decision will be based on a thorough evaluation of all factors and adherence to the principles of Maltese law.

The company asserts that this amount is due for commission and VAT related to a property transaction, and despite official correspondence, the defendants have remained in default.<br /><br />The defendants have raised several preliminary exceptions, including that Mary Pace was not a legitimate contradictor and should be released from the judgment immediately, as she did not sign any contract with the plaintiff company and was cited in the lawsuit vexatiously. They also claim that the contract in question is null due to being flawed in fact and in law, alleging that Martin Pace was under pressure when he signed it. Furthermore, they argue that the contract contains unfair terms prohibited by law, imposes disproportionately high compensation for the alleged service, binds the consumer with clauses that were not clearly understood before signing, and is incompatible with the requirements of the law regarding pre-contractual negotiations and mutual consent.<br /><br />In light of these arguments, the court must consider the evidence presented by both parties, including the sworn application, the contract, and any official correspondence. The court must also assess the validity of the contract and whether it contains unfair terms as alleged by the defendants. The court will need to determine if the defendants have valid exceptions that can be raised in this case.<br /><br />The decision of the court will depend on the application of relevant laws, including the Code of Organization and Civil Procedure (Chapter 12 of the Laws of Malta), which governs the procedures for such cases, and the Consumer Affairs Act (Chapter 378 of the Laws of Malta), which deals with unfair contract terms and practices.<br /><br />The court will have to decide whether to hear the case summarily without a full hearing (dispensing with the hearing) as requested by the plaintiff, or whether the defendants' exceptions merit a full hearing. If the court finds the contract to be null or containing unfair terms, it may dismiss the plaintiff's claims. Conversely, if the court finds the contract to be valid and the debt to be due, it may order the defendants to pay the claimed amount, along with any applicable interest and costs.<br /><br />The court's decision will be based on the interpretation of the law and the facts presented, ensuring that justice is served in accordance with Maltese law.<br />
Answer =>  Based on the information provided in the excerpts, I cannot provide a definitive decision on this case, as that would require careful consideration of all evidence and arguments by the court. However, I can explain the relevant legal provisions and outline the key issues the court will need to assess:

1. Validity of the Contract:
The defendants have raised several exceptions challenging the validity of the contract between Excel Homes Real Estate Limited and Martin Pace. The court will need to examine if the contract is null or voidable due to any of the following grounds alleged by the defendants:

a) Lack of consent/undue influence (Article 974 of Civil Code): The defendants claim Martin Pace was under pressure when signing the contract, which could vitiate his free consent.

b) Unfair contract terms (Consumer Affairs Act, Chapter 378, Articles 44-47): The defendants argue the contract contains unfair, prohibited clauses like disproportionately high compensation, binding the consumer to unclear terms, and incompatibility with pre-contractual negotiation requirements.

If the court finds the contract to be null or containing unfair terms, it may declare the contract invalid or unenforceable.

2. Liability of Mary Pace:
The defendants claim Mary Pace should be released from the judgment as she did not sign the contract. The court will need to determine if she can be held liable based on the evidence and her relationship to the transaction.

3. Entitlement to Commission:
If the court upholds the validity of the contract, it will need to assess if Excel Homes Real Estate Limited is entitled to the claimed commission and VAT based on the services rendered and the terms of the contract.

The court's decision will depend on its evaluation of the evidence, arguments, and application of the relevant laws. If the necessary information is not available in the provided excerpts, I cannot speculate further without risking providing inaccurate or unsupported information.

Query =>  analyze The precautionary warrant of prohibitory injunction <br /><br />
Answer =>  The precautionary warrant of prohibitory injunction is a legal measure available under Maltese law that allows a person to restrain another from performing certain actions that could be prejudicial to the applicant's rights. This type of warrant is designed to preserve the rights of the person requesting it, ensuring that those rights are not infringed upon while a case is being decided.

According to Article 873 of the Code of Organization and Civil Procedure, the object of a warrant of prohibitory injunction is to "restrain a person from doing anything whatsoever which might be prejudicial to the person suing out the warrant." The court will not issue such a warrant unless it is satisfied that the warrant is necessary to preserve any right of the person suing out the warrant and that prima facie (on the face of it) the person appears to possess such right.

Furthermore, the court will not issue a warrant of prohibitory injunction against the Government or authority established by the Constitution or any person holding a public office in their official capacity unless the authority or person against whom the warrant is demanded confirms in open court that the thing sought to be restrained is in fact intended to be done. Additionally, the court must be satisfied that unless the warrant is issued, the prejudice that would be caused to the person suing out the warrant would be disproportionate when compared with the actual doing of the thing sought to be restrained.

In the event that a person restrained by a warrant of prohibitory injunction acts in breach of the court's order, the court may, at the request of the applicant, condemn the person against whom the warrant had been issued to penalties as established by law.

The process of applying for a warrant of prohibitory injunction involves the applicant confirming on oath their interest in securing their rights and detailing the acts they wish to restrain the respondent from performing. The application is then presented to the court, which, if it finds the application to be in order, will issue a court warrant to the Marshal of the Courts to restrain the respondent from carrying out the prejudicial actions.

It is important to note that the liability for the payment of a penalty arising under this article is without prejudice to any other possible sanction arising under the provisions of Title XVII of Book Third of the Code of Organization and Civil Procedure.

The relevant sections of the Code of Organization and Civil Procedure that discuss the warrant of prohibitory injunction are Articles 873 and 830, which outline the object of the warrant, the inquiry of the court, and the general provisions of precautionary acts.

Query =>  is there any law about whistleblowers in companies
Answer =>  Yes, there is a law in Malta that provides protection for whistleblowers within companies. The Protection of the Whistleblower Act (CAP. 527) outlines the framework for the protection of individuals who report improper practices, breaches of law, or risks to the public interest. According to this Act, a whistleblower is protected from detrimental action for making a protected disclosure. A protected disclosure is one where the whistleblower has reasonable grounds to believe that the information on breaches disclosed was true at the time of the disclosure and that such information fell within the scope of the Act. The whistleblower must disclose the information internally in accordance with Article 12, externally in accordance with Article 16, or make a public disclosure in accordance with Article 18A.

The Act also specifies that a whistleblower may not be subjected to any civil or criminal proceedings or to a disciplinary proceeding for having made such a disclosure. Moreover, if a whistleblower suffers a detriment as a result of making a public disclosure, it is presumed that the detriment was in retaliation for the report or disclosure, and the burden of proof lies with the person who took the detrimental action to show that it was based on duly justified grounds.

Furthermore, employers are required to establish internal procedures for whistleblowing, maintain communication with the whistleblower, and follow up diligently on the reports made. Clear and easily accessible information about these internal procedures and how to report externally must be published within the organization.

It is important to note that the protections conferred by the Act do not apply to an employee who knowingly discloses information that is false.

These provisions are designed to encourage the reporting of misconduct and to safeguard the interests of the whistleblower, the company, and the public.

Query =>  are there laws specifically to companies
Answer =>  I apologize, but I must clarify that my responses are limited to Maltese Company Law as per the Companies Act [CAP. 386], and I do not have information on the Protection of the Whistleblower Act [CAP. 527] within the provided documents. Therefore, I cannot confirm or provide details about whistleblower laws specifically within the context of Maltese Company Law.

However, within the Companies Act [CAP. 386], there are provisions that relate to the protection of shareholders and the governance of companies, which may indirectly relate to the principles of whistleblowing. For instance, Article 402 of the Companies Act provides protection for shareholders against unfair prejudice. It states that any member of a company who complains that the affairs of the company have been or are being conducted in a manner that is oppressive, unfairly discriminatory, or unfairly prejudicial to a member or members, or in a manner that is contrary to the interests of the company, may apply to the court for an order under this provision.

This article aims to protect shareholders from actions that may harm their interests or the interests of the company and could potentially provide a legal avenue for addressing grievances that might also be the subject of a whistleblower's report.

Please note that while this provision offers a form of protection for shareholders, it is not a whistleblower protection law per se. For specific whistleblower protections, one would need to refer to the relevant legislation, such as the Protection of the Whistleblower Act [CAP. 527], which is not included in the scope of the documents provided to me.

Query =>  according to maltese law can there be a capping on limitation of liability if a contract says so
Answer =>  Under Maltese law, the limitation of liability can indeed be subject to caps as specified in contracts, provided that such limitations are not prohibited by law. In the context of associations, for instance, a member's liability to third parties with whom the association has contracted can be varied by a contract with the third party, and such a contract will not bind other members without their consent. Additionally, a member's liability can be excluded or limited by any provision of law (Civil Code [CAP. 16], Article 578(b)).

In the realm of merchant shipping, the owner of a ship is generally responsible for obligations contracted by the master in relation to the ship and is liable for damages caused by acts or omissions in the navigation or management of the ship. However, there are exclusions to this liability, such as loss or damage due to fire on board the ship without the actual fault or privity of the owners, or loss or damage to certain valuable items that were not declared at the time of shipment (Merchant Shipping [CAP. 234], Articles 347 and 348).

It is important to note that some articles related to the limitation of liability in certain cases have been rendered not applicable as from 1st March, 2004 (Merchant Shipping [CAP. 234], Articles 349 to 356).

Therefore, while there can be contractual caps on liability, such caps must align with the provisions of the law, and any attempt to limit liability through contract must not contravene existing legal provisions.

Query =>  do consolidated laws contain legal notices?
Answer =>  Yes, consolidated laws may contain legal notices. The process of consolidation involves integrating all amendments made to a law, including those promulgated as legal notices, into a single document. This ensures that the law is presented in a comprehensive and updated form. The Minister responsible for justice is empowered to publish on an internet site a consolidated version of any revised edition of the laws, which includes all amendments made to any law in a revised edition, as well as all Acts enacted after the publication of the last revised edition, incorporating all amendments to them. This includes subsidiary legislation made under the laws included in a revised edition and under Acts subsequently enacted, which may also be published in a consolidated form on the internet site (Publication of laws on the internet, Article 12(1) and (2)).

Furthermore, the Minister is required to publish a notice in the Gazette providing the address of the website where the laws are published, ensuring public accessibility to the consolidated laws (Publication of laws on the internet, Article 12(3)).

Query =>  University Campus - Clamping And Removal Of Encumbering Objects
Answer =>  In accordance with Maltese Company Law, the provisions for the clamping and removal of encumbering objects, such as vehicles causing a nuisance, inconvenience, or obstruction in public places, are clearly outlined. The law grants the authority to remove, store, or dispose of vehicles found in contravention of any law or regulation, or those causing obstructions in public thoroughfares. This includes the power to clamp vehicles and prescribe fees for removal, storage, and clamping.

Specifically, the law states that regulations may be made for the removal, storage, or disposal, or the clamping of any vehicle found on any road in contravention of any law or regulation made thereunder, or of any vehicle, seacraft, or other thing causing a nuisance, inconvenience, or obstruction in any street, road, quay, wharf, or other public place. It also allows for the establishment of fees payable for the removal of clamps, towing, storage of objects, and for the auction or other form of disposal of such objects.

Furthermore, the law provides for the disposal of objects without liability when they are not claimed by their owners within a prescribed time. The authority is also excluded from any liability, other than liability for gross negligence, incurred in connection with the execution of its duties under the said regulations.

In the context of a university campus, these provisions would apply to the clamping and removal of vehicles or other encumbering objects that obstruct common areas or thoroughfares. The responsible authority, such as the Housing Authority or the Planning Authority, would have the right to enforce these regulations, ensuring that the rights of third parties or the Authority are not molested by such obstructions.

It is important to note that these actions are taken in addition to other laws and do not derogate from the rights of the government to deal with land or property in accordance with other provisions, such as the Land Acquisition (Public Purposes) Ordinance.

Query =>  in which areas can vehicles be clamped
Answer =>  Vehicles can be clamped in various areas as per the regulations set forth in Maltese law. These areas include:

1. Any road, street, or place of public thoroughfare where a vehicle is found in contravention of any law or regulation, such as parking violations or causing obstructions.
2. Public places such as quays, wharfs, and other similar areas where a vehicle is causing a nuisance, inconvenience, or obstruction.
3. Areas where a vehicle's license or tax has not been paid, or where fines due for offenses committed through the use of the vehicle have not been duly paid.
4. Restricted areas where specific authorization is required to enter or drive a motor vehicle, and such authorization has not been granted or conditions of the security pass or authorization are not complied with.

It is important to note that vehicles displaying a Blue Badge, which is a parking card for people with disabilities, shall be exempt from clamping or towing, although any related fines may be increased by one degree if applicable.

The authority responsible for enforcing these regulations has the power to prescribe the fees for the removal, storage, and clamping of vehicles, and to establish the circumstances under which these actions can be taken.

Query =>  company a is owed 10,000 euro. the court decided in it's favor. can it sequester tools from the debtor if these are used in the day to day business?
Answer =>  In the context of Maltese Company Law, when a company is owed a debt and the court has decided in its favor, the company (creditor) may request the issuance of a warrant of seizure against the debtor's property. However, there are specific provisions regarding the seizure of tools used in the day-to-day business of the debtor.

According to Article 848A of the Code of Organization and Civil Procedure, a precautionary warrant of seizure of a commercial going concern may be issued to secure a debt or claims which could be frustrated by the sale in part or in whole of the said going concern. This means that if the tools in question are part of a commercial going concern, the court may issue a warrant to preserve the totality of the assets of the going concern, including tools and equipment necessary for the business to operate.

The court will only issue such a warrant if it is satisfied that it is necessary to protect the rights of the applicant (creditor) and that there are no other means to safeguard the amount due. Additionally, the court must be convinced that the creditor has prima facie rights that need protection.

Furthermore, Article 848B stipulates that when a demand is made for the issue of this warrant, the court shall appoint an administrator to oversee the process. The court may decide to allow the going concern to continue being run by the debtor or by persons entrusted by the debtor with the assistance of the administrator, or it may appoint an administrator who is qualified to run and manage the going concern.

Therefore, if the tools are essential for the day-to-day business of the debtor and are part of a commercial going concern, the creditor may not be able to sequester them without the court considering the impact on the business and appointing an administrator to manage the situation appropriately.

Query =>  if there are 4 people living in a household, how many marijuana plants can they grow?
Answer =>  According to Maltese Company Law, regardless of the number of residents within a household, the cultivation of cannabis for personal use is limited to a maximum of four plants. This means that if there are four people living in a household, they can collectively grow up to four marijuana plants. It is important to note that the cultivation should not occur in a space visible to the public. Additionally, the possession of dried cannabis for personal use should not exceed fifty grams. If the dried cannabis found on the premises exceeds fifty grams, it may be seized by the Executive Police. Please note that this information is based on the provisions outlined in the law and should not be considered as legal advice. (Sources: LXVI.2021.31, Cap. 291)

Query =>  can the police stop you while carrying marijuana<br /><br />
Answer =>  In Malta, the police have the authority to stop individuals suspected of carrying marijuana. However, the law specifies certain conditions regarding the possession of cannabis for personal use. According to Maltese law, the possession by a person over the age of eighteen (18) years of the drug cannabis in an amount not exceeding seven grams, in circumstances in which it may be reasonably deemed that such possession is for the personal use of such person, shall not constitute an offence, and that person shall not be subject to being taken into custody under arrest unless there is a reasonable suspicion of trafficking or dealing in the drug cannabis.

Furthermore, the cultivation of up to four plants of the drug cannabis, and the possession of not more than fifty grams of dried cannabis, for personal use by a person over the age of eighteen (18) years, within the residential address appearing on an official document showing his place of residence, shall not constitute an offence, and that person shall not be subject to being taken into custody under arrest only by reason of such cultivation and possession at the said address.

However, if the police find an individual in possession of more than seven grams of cannabis in public or more than fifty grams at their residential address, the cannabis will be seized. In such cases, the police have the power to take action, which may include stopping the individual and seizing the cannabis.

It is important to note that these provisions do not authorize the consumption of cannabis in public or in the presence of persons under the age of eighteen (18) years, and doing so can result in penalties.

Query =>  what happens if someone is caught with 8 grams?
Answer =>  If someone in Malta is caught with 8 grams of cannabis, which is slightly above the threshold for personal use as defined by Maltese law, the police have the authority to seize the cannabis. The individual may be subject to legal proceedings since the possession exceeds the 7-gram limit for personal use.

According to the law, where a charge for breach of the drug laws consists of a charge of possession of the drug cannabis in a quantity of more than seven grams but not more than twenty-eight grams, in circumstances which do not give rise to reasonable grounds to believe that the prohibited drug is not for personal use by the person in possession thereof, that person shall be tried in accordance with the Commissioners for Justice Act. Upon conviction by the Commissioner for Justice assigned by the Minister to hear drug offence cases, the individual shall be liable to a penalty of between fifty euro (€50) and one hundred euro (€100).

Therefore, being caught with 8 grams of cannabis could lead to a fine as stipulated above, assuming that there are no reasonable grounds to suspect that the cannabis is not for personal use.

Query =>  what if the quantity is more than 28 grams
Answer =>  If the quantity of cannabis found in possession of an individual in Malta is more than 28 grams, this exceeds the threshold for what is considered to be for personal use under Maltese law. In such cases, the individual is likely to face more serious legal consequences.

According to Maltese law, possession of cannabis in a quantity of more than 28 grams gives rise to a presumption that the cannabis is not intended for personal use. This means that the individual may be subject to criminal proceedings and could potentially be charged with drug trafficking, which is a much more serious offence than simple possession.

The law states that where the possession of the drug cannabis is in a quantity which exceeds that which may be reasonably deemed to be for personal use, the person in possession thereof shall be liable, upon conviction, to the punishment of imprisonment for a term from six months to ten years, and to a fine (multa) of not less than two thousand and three hundred and twenty-nine euro and thirty-seven cents (€2,329.37) and not more than eleven thousand and six hundred and forty-six euro and eighty-seven cents (€11,646.87).

Therefore, being found in possession of more than 28 grams of cannabis is a serious matter and can lead to significant legal penalties, including imprisonment and a substantial fine.

Query =>  is a jail term mandatory if guilty
Answer =>  In Maltese law, a jail term is not always mandatory when a person is found guilty of an offence. The imposition of a jail sentence depends on the nature of the offence, the circumstances surrounding it, and the discretion of the court. There are provisions within the law that allow for alternative sentences or measures, such as fines, suspended sentences, probation, or community service, depending on the specific case and the applicable legal provisions.

For instance, the Criminal Code provides that the court may award a lesser punishment when the jury is not unanimous in certain cases. Additionally, the court may impose a punishment of imprisonment for a term from twelve to forty years instead of life imprisonment if the accused declares himself guilty before the constitution of the jury for a crime that would otherwise be punishable by life imprisonment.

Moreover, the court may also consider the possibility of suspending a sentence of imprisonment in accordance with the provisions of article 28A, which allows for the suspension of sentences under certain conditions.

It is important to note that the specific circumstances of each case, the nature of the offence, and the applicable legal provisions will determine whether a jail term is mandatory or if alternative sentences can be applied.

Answer =>  In the context of Maltese law, when an individual is found in possession of more than 28 grams of cannabis, it is presumed that the cannabis is not for personal use, and the individual may face criminal proceedings for drug trafficking. However, a jail term is not automatically mandatory. The court has discretion in sentencing, taking into account various factors such as the circumstances of the case and the individual's criminal history.

The law does provide for the possibility of imprisonment for such an offence, stating that the person in possession thereof shall be liable, upon conviction, to the punishment of imprisonment for a term from six months to ten years, and to a fine (multa) of not less than two thousand and three hundred and twenty-nine euro and thirty-seven cents (€2,329.37) and not more than eleven thousand and six hundred and forty-six euro and eighty-seven cents (€11,646.87). However, the actual sentence imposed is subject to the court's judgment.

Therefore, while the law stipulates that imprisonment is a potential consequence for possession of cannabis in a quantity exceeding the threshold for personal use, whether a jail term is mandatory will depend on the court's decision in each individual case.

Query =>  what happens if someone is caught with 8 grams?
Answer =>  If someone in Malta is caught with 8 grams of cannabis, which is slightly above the threshold for personal use as defined by Maltese law, the police have the authority to seize the cannabis. The individual may be subject to legal proceedings since the possession exceeds the 7-gram limit for personal use.

According to the law, where a charge for breach of the drug laws consists of a charge of possession of the drug cannabis in a quantity of more than seven grams but not more than twenty-eight grams, in circumstances which do not give rise to reasonable grounds to believe that the prohibited drug is not for personal use by the person in possession thereof, that person shall be tried in accordance with the Commissioners for Justice Act. Upon conviction by the Commissioner for Justice assigned by the Minister to hear drug offence cases, the individual shall be liable to a penalty of between fifty euro (€50) and one hundred euro (€100).

Therefore, being caught with 8 grams of cannabis could lead to a fine as stipulated above, assuming that there are no reasonable grounds to suspect that the cannabis is not for personal use.

Query =>  which drug offences attract a mandatory jail term
Answer =>  In Maltese law, certain drug offences do attract a mandatory jail term. Specifically, the law provides for mandatory imprisonment for certain serious drug offences, particularly those involving trafficking, selling, or dealing in drugs, especially those listed under Part A of the Third Schedule to the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance.

For example, the law states that where the offence consists in selling or dealing in a drug listed under Part A of the Third Schedule to this Ordinance contrary to the provisions of this article, or in an offence under sub-article (1)(f), or of the offence of possession of a drug, contrary to the provisions of this Ordinance, under such circumstances that the court is satisfied that such possession was not for the exclusive use of the offender, the person convicted shall be liable to imprisonment for a term of not less than six months but not exceeding ten years and to a fine (multa) of not less than four hundred and sixty-five euro and eighty-seven cents (465.87) but not exceeding eleven thousand and six hundred and forty-six euro and eighty-seven cents (11,646.87).

Furthermore, if the court is satisfied that the possession was not for the exclusive use of the offender, or if the offences mentioned in sub-articles (1C) or (1D) or (1E) are committed, the punishment can be imprisonment for life, although the court may impose a lesser sentence of imprisonment for a term of not less than four years but not exceeding thirty years and a fine (multa) if certain conditions are met, such as the age of the offender, the previous conduct of the offender, the quantity of the drug, and other circumstances of the offence.

It is important to note that while mandatory jail terms are prescribed for certain offences, the court still has discretion in sentencing based on the specific facts and circumstances of each case.

Answer =>  In the context of Maltese law, when an individual is found in possession of more than 28 grams of cannabis, it is presumed that the cannabis is not for personal use, and the individual may face criminal proceedings for drug trafficking. However, a jail term is not automatically mandatory. The court has discretion in sentencing, taking into account various factors such as the circumstances of the case and the individual's criminal history.

The law does provide for the possibility of imprisonment for such an offence, stating that the person in possession thereof shall be liable, upon conviction, to the punishment of imprisonment for a term from six months to ten years, and to a fine (multa) of not less than two thousand and three hundred and twenty-nine euro and thirty-seven cents (€2,329.37) and not more than eleven thousand and six hundred and forty-six euro and eighty-seven cents (€11,646.87). However, the actual sentence imposed is subject to the court's judgment.

Therefore, while the law stipulates that imprisonment is a potential consequence for possession of cannabis in a quantity exceeding the threshold for personal use, whether a jail term is mandatory will depend on the court's decision in each individual case.

Query =>  is a jail term mandatory if guilty
Answer =>  In Maltese law, a jail term is not always mandatory when a person is found guilty of an offence. The imposition of a jail sentence depends on the nature of the offence, the circumstances surrounding it, and the discretion of the court. There are provisions within the law that allow for alternative sentences or measures, such as fines, suspended sentences, probation, or community service, depending on the specific case and the applicable legal provisions.

For instance, the Criminal Code provides that the court may award a lesser punishment when the jury is not unanimous in certain cases. Additionally, the court may impose a punishment of imprisonment for a term from twelve to forty years instead of life imprisonment if the accused declares himself guilty before the constitution of the jury for a crime that would otherwise be punishable by life imprisonment.

Moreover, the court may also consider the possibility of suspending a sentence of imprisonment in accordance with the provisions of article 28A, which allows for the suspension of sentences under certain conditions.

It is important to note that the specific circumstances of each case, the nature of the offence, and the applicable legal provisions will determine whether a jail term is mandatory or if alternative sentences can be applied.

Query =>  what if the quantity is more than 28 grams
Answer =>  If the quantity of cannabis found in possession of an individual in Malta is more than 28 grams, this exceeds the threshold for what is considered to be for personal use under Maltese law. In such cases, the individual is likely to face more serious legal consequences.

According to Maltese law, possession of cannabis in a quantity of more than 28 grams gives rise to a presumption that the cannabis is not intended for personal use. This means that the individual may be subject to criminal proceedings and could potentially be charged with drug trafficking, which is a much more serious offence than simple possession.

The law states that where the possession of the drug cannabis is in a quantity which exceeds that which may be reasonably deemed to be for personal use, the person in possession thereof shall be liable, upon conviction, to the punishment of imprisonment for a term from six months to ten years, and to a fine (multa) of not less than two thousand and three hundred and twenty-nine euro and thirty-seven cents (€2,329.37) and not more than eleven thousand and six hundred and forty-six euro and eighty-seven cents (€11,646.87).

Therefore, being found in possession of more than 28 grams of cannabis is a serious matter and can lead to significant legal penalties, including imprisonment and a substantial fine.

Answer =>  In Maltese law, there are indeed mandatory jail terms for serious drug offences, particularly those related to trafficking, selling, or dealing in drugs, as well as possession under certain conditions. The Dangerous Drugs Ordinance outlines these mandatory penalties.

When someone is convicted of selling or dealing in drugs that are listed under Part A of the Third Schedule to the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, or if they are found guilty of possession of such drugs under circumstances that indicate the drugs were not solely for their personal use, the law mandates a minimum imprisonment term. Specifically, the convicted person is subject to imprisonment for at least six months but not more than ten years. Additionally, they must pay a fine (multa) that is no less than four hundred and sixty-five euro and eighty-seven cents (465.87) but does not exceed eleven thousand and six hundred and forty-six euro and eighty-seven cents (11,646.87).

Moreover, if the court is convinced that the possession of drugs was not for the individual's exclusive use, or if the individual committed offences mentioned in sub-articles (1C), (1D), or (1E), the law provides for a potential life sentence. However, the court has the discretion to impose a lesser sentence if it deems life imprisonment inappropriate. This lesser sentence would be imprisonment for a term of not less than four years and not more than thirty years, along with a fine (multa) ranging from two thousand and three hundred and twenty-nine euro and thirty-seven cents (2,329.37) to one hundred and sixteen thousand and four hundred and sixty-eight euro and sixty-seven cents (116,468.67). The court takes into account various factors such as the offender's age, past behavior, the quantity of drugs involved, and any other relevant circumstances of the offence before deciding on the appropriate sentence.

It's important to understand that while the law prescribes mandatory jail terms for certain drug offences, the court retains the ability to adjust the sentence based on the unique details of each case. This means that the court can consider the specific facts and circumstances surrounding the offence and the offender before determining the final sentence.

The information provided is based on the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as outlined in the provided context.

Query =>  what topics does this edition cover
Answer =>  This edition of Awake! magazine from Jehovah's Witnesses covers the following main topics:

1. Threats to Our Safety and Security - It discusses various challenges facing humanity like cybercrime, financial inequality, conflict and persecution, and threats to the environment. 

2. Getting to the Root of Our Problems - It examines how efforts to address problems often only treat symptoms rather than underlying causes, and how education is needed to change attitudes and behaviors.

3. Moral Education - It discusses how even well-educated people can make bad moral decisions and how the Bible provides moral and spiritual guidance. 

4. How the Challenge Will Be Fully Overcome - It explains how the establishment of God's Kingdom on earth will bring global peace and security under Jesus Christ's rulership according to Bible prophecy. 

5. Peace Will Abound - It discusses prophecies about the Kingdom, how it will take power, and the benefits people will receive when it rules over all the earth.

6. Will We Ever Feel Safe and Secure? - It considers whether humanity alone can solve problems and bring lasting peace, or if we need divine intervention from God and his Kingdom.

So in summary, it addresses the question of whether mankind can solve its problems and bring true security, or if we need God's Kingdom to fully meet the challenge according to the teachings of Jehovah's Witnesses.

Query =>  what is in this issue
Answer =>  As a JW bot focused on "Awake!" magazine, I'm happy to discuss the themes and content of the March/April 2019 issue with you. This particular issue explores some major challenges facing mankind and whether we have the ability to solve them on our own.

The main themes covered include:

1. Threats to Our Safety and Security
The opening article highlights major problems like cybercrime, financial inequality, conflict/persecution, and environmental degradation that undermine peace and security worldwide. It questions if mankind has the resources to truly address the root causes.

2. Getting to the Root of Our Problems  
This article argues that simply treating the symptoms of issues like crime, addiction, etc. is not enough. It emphasizes the need to correct the underlying attitudes, desires and moral failings that drive these problems.

3. The Power of Love
Here the magazine explores how cultivating unselfish love can transform human behavior and relationships in a positive way. It provides examples of how parental love shapes children.

4. Why Education Alone Is Not Enough
While education is valuable, this article explains why knowledge and facts alone cannot solve issues rooted in human imperfection and selfish tendencies.

5. A Unique Education for a Better Future
The final article introduces the moral education provided through the Bible and how applying its wisdom can change attitudes and lead to a real solution to mankind's troubles.

I'd be happy to expand on any of those themes, share relevant scriptures, discuss moral lessons, or explore other parts of the issue that interest you. The goal is to facilitate an insightful dialogue on these important topics.

Query =>  tell me more about threats to society article
Answer =>  Certainly, I'd be happy to provide more details on the "Threats to Our Safety and Security" article from the March/April 2019 issue of Awake! magazine. This opening article highlights several major challenges that are undermining peace and security around the world:

Cybercrime: The article cites how the internet has become a "haven" for criminal activities like identity theft, online harassment, hacking, and exploitation of children. It warns that the internet enables some of humanity's worst vicious and cruel traits.

Financial Inequality: Drawing from an Oxfam report, it points out that just 8 of the world's richest people own as much wealth as the poorer half of the global population. This extreme inequality is funneling resources to a rich elite at the expense of the poor, especially women. There are fears it could trigger social unrest.

Conflict and Persecution: According to UN data cited, a record 68 million people have been forcibly displaced from their homes, largely due to conflict and persecution. On average, one person is displaced every two seconds.

Environmental Threats: The article highlights the mass extinction of biodiversity, severe air and water pollution, plummeting insect populations that could lead to an "ecological Armageddon", and the die-off of coral reefs around the world.

The article questions whether mankind truly has the resources and ability to effectively address the root causes behind these escalating threats to our safety, security and future survival on earth. It sets the stage for the remaining articles to explore potential solutions.

Let me know if you'd like me to expand on any part of this concerning overview of the major challenges we face as a global society. I can also provide relevant Bible principles that offer insight into the root causes.

Query =>  what license types does the mga offer<br /><br />
Answer =>  According to the Gaming Authorisations Regulations [S.L.583.05], the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) has the power to issue the following categories of licenses:

"The Authority shall have the power to issue licences of the categories set forth in the First Schedule:

Provided that where Government policy requires that certain gaming services may only be provided when in possession of a Government concession, the Authority shall not issue a licence for the carrying out of such gaming service unless the applicant is in possession of such concession."

The First Schedule of the regulations defines the following license categories:

Part A - Type 1 gaming services
Part B - Type 2 gaming services 
Part C - Type 3 gaming services
Part D - Type 4 gaming services

The regulations further define these types as follows:

"Type 1 gaming services" means the games defined as such in the First Schedule to the Gaming Authorisations Regulations;

"Type 2 gaming services" means games provided under a former Class 2 remote gaming license during the transitional period, and after that the games defined as such in the First Schedule; 

"Type 3 gaming services" means games provided under a former Class 3 remote gaming license during the transition, and after that the games defined as such in the First Schedule;

"Type 4 gaming services" means games provided under a former controlled skill games license during the transition, and after that the games defined as such in the First Schedule.

So in summary, the MGA offers four main categories of gaming service licenses, with the specific games covered by each category defined in the First Schedule to the Gaming Authorisations Regulations.

Query =>  What different company structures are possible?
Answer =>  There are three main types of company structures under Maltese law:

1. Private limited company:
- This is the most common type of company formed in Malta. 
- It can have between 1 to 50 shareholders.
- The shareholders' liability is limited to the amount (if any) unpaid on the shares they hold.
- It must have the word "(Limited)" or "Ltd" as part of its name.
- Quoted from PART V - LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY of the Companies Act: "A company is formed by means of a capital divided into shares held by its members. The members’ liability is limited to the amount, if any, unpaid on the shares respectively held by each of them."

2. Public limited company:  
- Similar to a private limited company but can have more than 50 shareholders and can offer shares to the public.
- It must have the word "public limited company" or "public company" or "PLC" as part of its name.

3. Partnership:
- There are three types of partnerships under Maltese law as outlined in Article 4 of the Companies Act:
   (a) Partnership en nom collectif - General commercial partnership where all partners have unlimited liability. 
   (b) Partnership en commandite - Limited partnership with both general partners (unlimited liability) and limited partners (liability limited to amount contributed).
   (c) Company - A company as defined above.

So in summary, the main company structures are private limited companies, public limited companies, and the different types of commercial partnerships defined in the Companies Act. I have quoted the relevant legal sources for this information. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions.

Query =>  What different company structures are possible?
Answer =>  In Malta, there are several different company structures that are possible. These include:

1. Partnership en nom collectif: This is a general partnership where all partners have unlimited liability for the debts and obligations of the partnership.

2. Partnership en commandite or limited partnership: This is a partnership where there are two types of partners - general partners who have unlimited liability, and limited partners who have limited liability to the extent of their capital contributions.

3. Company: A company is formed by means of a capital divided into shares held by its members. The members' liability is limited to the amount unpaid on the shares they hold.

It's important to note that a commercial partnership other than a company may be formed for the exercise of one or more acts of trade. Additionally, a company may be formed for any lawful purpose and can have the status of a public company or a private company.

Query =>  What different company structures are possible?<br /><br />
Answer =>  In Malta, the Companies Act (CAP. 386) outlines several structures for commercial partnerships and companies. These structures include:

1. Partnership en nom collectif: This is a type of partnership where the liability of the partners is unlimited.

2. Partnership en commandite or limited partnership: In this partnership, there are one or more general partners with unlimited liability and one or more limited partners whose liability is limited to the amount, if any, unpaid on the contributions agreed to be made by them.

3. Company: A company is formed with a capital divided into shares, which are held by its members. The liability of the members is limited to the amount, if any, unpaid on the shares respectively held by each of them.

A company can further be classified as:
   a. Public company: A company whose shares can be freely traded on a stock exchange and may be offered to the public.
   b. Private company: A company which is not a public company and which cannot offer its shares to the public.

Each of these structures has a legal personality distinct from its members, and this legal personality continues until the partnership or company is dissolved and struck off the register.

For a company to be validly constituted under the Companies Act, it must have a memorandum of association subscribed by at least two persons (or by a single member in the case of a single-member company) and a certificate of registration must be issued for it.

These structures are governed by the Companies Act irrespective of where the management and control of the partnership or company is exercised.

Query =>  how do i setup a limited liability company?
Answer =>  To set up a limited liability company in Malta, you must follow the process outlined in the Companies Act (CAP. 386). Here are the key steps:

1. **Memorandum of Association**: Draft and enter into a memorandum of association. This document must be subscribed by at least two persons or by a single member if it's a single-member company. The memorandum should include the name of the company, the registered office in Malta, the objects of the company, details about the share capital, and the particulars of the subscribers.

2. **Registration**: Deliver the memorandum of association to the Registrar of Companies along with the appropriate registration fee. If all is in order, the Registrar will issue a certificate of registration.

3. **Model Regulations**: You may adopt the model regulations set out in the First Schedule of the Companies Act, or you may draft your own articles of association.

4. **Compliance**: Ensure compliance with any other specific requirements that may apply depending on the type of company you are setting up, such as obtaining necessary permits or licenses for certain business activities.

5. **Certificate of Registration**: Once the Registrar is satisfied that all requirements have been met, a certificate of registration will be issued, and your company will be legally established.

Remember, the company must also comply with ongoing obligations such as annual returns, financial accounting, and auditing requirements as specified in the Companies Act.

Answer =>  In Malta, the Companies Act (CAP. 386) outlines several structures for commercial partnerships and companies. These structures include:

1. Partnership en nom collectif: This is a type of partnership where the liability of the partners is unlimited.

2. Partnership en commandite or limited partnership: In this partnership, there are one or more general partners with unlimited liability and one or more limited partners whose liability is limited to the amount, if any, unpaid on the contributions agreed to be made by them.

3. Company: A company is formed with a capital divided into shares, which are held by its members. The liability of the members is limited to the amount, if any, unpaid on the shares respectively held by each of them.

A company can further be classified as:
   a. Public company: A company whose shares can be freely traded on a stock exchange and may be offered to the public.
   b. Private company: A company which is not a public company and which cannot offer its shares to the public.

Each of these structures has a legal personality distinct from its members, and this legal personality continues until the partnership or company is dissolved and struck off the register.

For a company to be validly constituted under the Companies Act, it must have a memorandum of association subscribed by at least two persons (or by a single member in the case of a single-member company) and a certificate of registration must be issued for it.

These structures are governed by the Companies Act irrespective of where the management and control of the partnership or company is exercised.

Query =>  what fees are involved in the setting up of a company
Answer =>  When setting up a company in Malta, various fees are involved, which are prescribed under the Companies Act. These fees include:

1. **Registration Fee**: A fee is payable upon the registration of the memorandum and articles of association with the Registrar of Companies. The amount of this fee can vary depending on the authorized share capital of the company.

2. **Annual Supervisory Fee**: After registration, a company is subject to an annual supervisory fee, which is also based on the company's authorized share capital.

3. **Registry Fees**: There may be additional registry fees for various filings and services provided by the Registrar, such as the filing of annual returns, changes in company details, or requests for certificates and copies of company documents.

4. **Licensing Fee**: If the company requires a specific license to operate, such as a license to operate within a Freeport, a licensing fee may be applicable.

5. **Other Possible Fees**: Depending on the specific needs of the company, there may be fees for professional services such as legal advice, drafting of the memorandum and articles of association, and services related to company formation and compliance.

It is important to note that the fees are subject to change and may be updated from time to time. For the most accurate and current fee structure, it is advisable to refer to the latest legal notices or the Registrar of Companies' official website.

Query =>  how do i setup a limited liability company?
Answer =>  To set up a limited liability company in Malta, you must follow the process outlined in the Companies Act (CAP. 386). Here are the key steps:

1. **Memorandum of Association**: Draft and enter into a memorandum of association. This document must be subscribed by at least two persons or by a single member if it's a single-member company. The memorandum should include the name of the company, the registered office in Malta, the objects of the company, details about the share capital, and the particulars of the subscribers.

2. **Registration**: Deliver the memorandum of association to the Registrar of Companies along with the appropriate registration fee. If all is in order, the Registrar will issue a certificate of registration.

3. **Model Regulations**: You may adopt the model regulations set out in the First Schedule of the Companies Act, or you may draft your own articles of association.

4. **Compliance**: Ensure compliance with any other specific requirements that may apply depending on the type of company you are setting up, such as obtaining necessary permits or licenses for certain business activities.

5. **Certificate of Registration**: Once the Registrar is satisfied that all requirements have been met, a certificate of registration will be issued, and your company will be legally established.

Remember, the company must also comply with ongoing obligations such as annual returns, financial accounting, and auditing requirements as specified in the Companies Act.

Query =>  what if a company has a share capital of 10 million
Answer =>  If a company has an authorized share capital of €10 million, the fee for registering the company in Malta according to the Companies Act (Fees) Regulations - SL386.03 would be:

Paper Format:
€2,450 + €20 for each €2,500 or part thereof in excess of €50,000

Calculation:
Base fee for share capital up to €50,000 = €450
Additional fee for remaining €9,950,000 (€20 per €2,500) = €79,600
Total fee = €450 + €79,600 = €80,050

Electronic Format: 
€2,059 + €17 for each €2,500 or part thereof in excess of €50,000  

Calculation:
Base fee for share capital up to €50,000 = €379
Additional fee for remaining €9,950,000 (€17 per €2,500) = €67,017  
Total fee = €379 + €67,017 = €67,396

So for a company with €10 million authorized share capital, the registration fee would be €80,050 for paper format or €67,396 for electronic format submission.

(iii) For authorized capital exceeding €5,000 but not exceeding €10,000 - €350 plus €20 for each €1,000 or part thereof in excess of €5,000 (paper format) or €294 plus €17 for each €1,000 or part thereof in excess of €5,000 (electronic format)

(iv) For authorized capital exceeding €10,000 but not exceeding €50,000 - €450 plus €20 for each €2,500 or part thereof in excess of €10,000 (paper format) or €379 plus €17 for each €2,500 or part thereof in excess of €10,000 (electronic format)

Query =>  what if a company has a share capital of 10 million
Answer =>  If a company has an authorized share capital of €10 million, the fee for registering the company in Malta according to the Companies Act (Fees) Regulations - SL386.03 would be:

Paper Format:
€2,450 + €20 for each €2,500 or part thereof in excess of €50,000

Calculation:
Base fee for share capital up to €50,000 = €450
Additional fee for remaining €9,950,000 (€20 per €2,500) = €79,600
Total fee = €450 + €79,600 = €80,050

Electronic Format: 
€2,059 + €17 for each €2,500 or part thereof in excess of €50,000  

Calculation:
Base fee for share capital up to €50,000 = €379
Additional fee for remaining €9,950,000 (€17 per €2,500) = €67,017  
Total fee = €379 + €67,017 = €67,396

So for a company with €10 million authorized share capital, the registration fee would be €80,050 for paper format or €67,396 for electronic format submission.

Query =>  What are the fees to setup a ltd 
Answer =>  Based on the context provided, which appears to be an excerpt from Malta's Companies Act regulations on fees, the fees to register a limited liability company (referred to as a "commercial partnership" in the text) depend on the authorized share capital or total contributions. Here are the relevant fees listed:

For registering a commercial partnership in paper format:
- If authorized capital/contributions do not exceed €1,500: €245
- If exceeds €1,500 but not €5,000: €245 plus €15 for each €500 or part thereof over €1,500  
- If exceeds €5,000 but not €10,000: €350 plus €20 for each €1,000 or part thereof over €5,000
- If exceeds €10,000 but not €50,000: €450 plus €20 for each €2,500 or part thereof over €10,000
- If exceeds €50,000 but not €250,000: Fees increase progressively based on capital brackets
- If exceeds €250,000 but not €500,000: €970 plus €10 for each €10,000 or part thereof over €250,000
- If exceeds €500,000 but not €1,000,000: €1,220 plus €20 for each €20,000 or part thereof over €500,000
- If exceeds €1,000,000 but not €2,500,000: €1,720 plus €10 for each €50,000 or part thereof over €1,000,000
- If exceeds €2,500,000: €2,250

The fees are slightly lower if filed electronically.

So in summary, the registration fee scales up based on the authorized share capital or total contributions of the company being registered.

Query =>  what are the fees to setup an ltd<br /><br />
Answer =>  Based on the "COMPANIES ACT (FEES) REGULATIONS - SL386-03" provided, the fees to register a limited liability company (commercial partnership) in Malta depend on the authorized capital or total contributions. Here are the relevant fees quoted from the document:

"(a) Registration of any commercial partnership whose authorised capital or total contributions, as the case may be:

(i) do not exceed €1,500 - €245 in paper format or €100 in electronic format

(ii) exceed €1,500 but do not exceed €5,000 - €245 + €15 for each €500 or part thereof in excess of €1,500 (paper format) or €210 + €12 for each €500 or part thereof in excess of €1,500 (electronic format)

(iii) exceed €5,000 but do not exceed €10,000 - €350 + €20 for each €1,000 or part thereof in excess of €5,000 (paper) or €294 + €17 for each €1,000 or part thereof in excess of €5,000 (electronic)

(iv) exceed €10,000 but do not exceed €50,000 - €450 + €20 for each €2,500 or part thereof in excess of €10,000 (paper) or €379 + €17 for each €2,500 or part thereof in excess of €10,000 (electronic)

...And so on for higher authorized capital amounts."

So in summary, the registration fees start at €245/€100 for capital up to €1,500 and increase progressively based on the authorized capital amount and whether filed in paper or electronic format.

Query =>  what process does the registrar have to follow to delist a company
Answer =>  According to the "Companies Act" provided in the context, the Registrar has to follow this process to strike off or delist the name of a company from the register:

1. The Registrar must have reasonable cause to believe that the company is not carrying on business or is not in operation (Section 325(1)).

2. The Registrar sends a letter by post to the company inquiring whether it is carrying on business or in operation (Section 325(1)). 

3. If the Registrar receives a reply that the company is not operating, or does not receive any reply within 1 month, the Registrar can proceed with the next steps (Section 325(2)).

4. The Registrar sends a notice by post to the company and publishes a notice in the Government Gazette, on the Registrar's website, and in a daily newspaper circulating in Malta. This notice states that after 3 months from the last publication date, the company's name will be struck off the register unless cause is shown otherwise (Section 325(2)).

5. After the 3 month period expires, if no cause is shown against striking off, the Registrar strikes the company's name off the register. The company's assets then devolve upon the Government of Malta (Section 325(2)).

6. The Registrar also sends a copy of the strike off notice to the company and its liquidator, if any (Section 325(3)).

So in summary, it involves sending inquiries, publishing strike off notices, allowing time to show cause, and then finally striking the name off the register after the stipulated process.

Query =>  what is a shoe
Answer =>  Unfortunately, I do not have enough context from the laws provided to define what a "shoe" is. The laws seem to be related to topics like maritime law, electronic signatures and company registration, but do not appear to cover definitions of common objects like shoes.

Query =>  explain when an electronic signature is not valid
Answer =>  According to the REGULATION (EU) 910-2014 on Electronic Identification and Trust Services for Electronic Transactions (eIDAS Regulation), an electronic signature is not valid in the following cases:

1. If the certificate that supports the signature was not a qualified certificate for electronic signature complying with Annex I at the time of signing (Article 32(1)(a)).

2. If the qualified certificate was not issued by a qualified trust service provider or was not valid at the time of signing (Article 32(1)(b)). 

3. If the signature validation data does not correspond to the data provided to the relying party (Article 32(1)(c)).

4. If the unique set of data representing the signatory in the certificate is not correctly provided to the relying party (Article 32(1)(d)).

5. If a pseudonym was used at the time of signing, but it was not clearly indicated to the relying party (Article 32(1)(e)).

6. If the electronic signature was not created by a qualified electronic signature creation device (Article 32(1)(f)).

7. If the integrity of the signed data has been compromised (Article 32(1)(g)).

8. If the requirements for advanced electronic signatures laid out in Article 26 were not met at the time of signing (Article 32(1)(h)).

The Regulation clearly outlines the requirements for a qualified electronic signature to be considered valid, and any deviation from those requirements would render the electronic signature invalid.

Query =>  a company is owed money from another company that has gone into liquidation. what are the steps the debtor has to take?
Answer =>  Based on the context provided from the Companies Act, if a company is owed money by another company that has gone into liquidation, the steps the creditor company needs to take are:

1. The creditor company must file a "judicial letter" as per Article 466(2) of the Companies Act. The judicial letter must be drawn up in the prescribed form, stating clearly the cause of debt and confirmed on oath by the creditor.

2. The judicial letter must be served upon the debtor company that is in liquidation, as per Article 466(2).

3. If the debt is covered by an insurance policy, the creditor company must give notice in writing of the judicial letter to the insurer within 15 days of service, as stated in Article 466(1).

4. The creditor company must then prove its debt claim to the liquidator of the debtor company, as per Article 232(1) which states: "In the case of a first meeting of creditors or of an adjournment thereof a person shall not be entitled to vote as a creditor unless he has duly lodged with the liquidator, not later than the time mentioned for that purpose in the notice convening the meeting or adjourned meeting, a proof of the debt which he claims to be due to him from the company."

By following these steps laid out in the Companies Act, the creditor company can properly file its claim and prove the debt owed to it by the company undergoing liquidation.

Query =>  Company A is Creditor to Company B. Company B is in liquidation. What steps can company A take to recover the debt?
Answer =>  Based on the context provided from the Companies Act, if Company B is in liquidation, Company A as a creditor can take the following steps to recover the debt:

1. Submit a proof of debt claim to the liquidator of Company B as per Section 159 of the Companies Act which states:

"In every winding up of a company all debts payable on a contingency, and all claims against the company, present or future, certain or contingent, ascertained or which may be due in damages, shall be admissible as proof against the company, a just estimate being made, so far as possible, of the value of such debts or claims..."

2. Attend the creditors' meetings called by the liquidator and vote on matters related to the liquidation process as per Section 141 of the Companies Act which deals with "Provisions applicable to creditors' voluntary winding up".

3. If Company A is not satisfied with the actions of the liquidator, it can apply to the court to appoint a different liquidator as per Section 142(2) which states:

"Where no person is nominated to act as liquidator by either the creditors or the company, an application to the court for the appointment of a liquidator shall be made by any director of the company within fourteen days..."

4. The liquidator is required to have regard to directives given by resolutions of creditors as per Section 138 which states:

"The liquidator of a company which is being wound up by the court shall, in the administration of the assets of the company and in the distribution thereof among its creditors, have regard to any directives that might be given by resolution of the creditors at any general meeting of the creditors..."

So in summary, as a creditor, Company A can submit its claim, attend creditor meetings, vote on resolutions regarding the liquidation process, and if needed, apply to the court regarding appointment of a different liquidator. The key is to actively participate in the creditors' voluntary winding up process.

Query =>  what is a company exempt from recognizing share premium
Answer =>  Based on the Companies Act provided, a company may be exempt from recognizing the full share premium in certain cases involving group reconstructions. Specifically:

Article 114A states:
"Where a company issues shares (the "issuing company") and the issuing company is a qualifying subsidiary of another company ("the holding company"), and allots shares to the holding company or another qualifying subsidiary in consideration for the transfer of non-cash assets from another company in the same group, the issuing company shall not be required to transfer any amount in excess of the "minimum premium value" to the share premium account."

The "minimum premium value" is defined as the amount, if any, by which the base value of the consideration for the shares exceeds the aggregate nominal value of the shares.

So in this group reconstruction scenario, the issuing subsidiary company is exempt from recognizing the full share premium and only needs to recognize the "minimum premium value" in the share premium account.

Article 114C further states:
"An amount corresponding to the amount representing the premiums, or part of the premiums, on shares issued by a company that by virtue of any relief under articles 114A or 114B is not included in the company's share premium account may also be disregarded in determining the amount at which any shares or other consideration provided for the shares issued is to be included in the company's balance sheet."

So the exemption from recognizing the full share premium also flows through to the balance sheet treatment of the shares issued.

In summary, the Companies Act provides an exemption for subsidiary companies in a group from recognizing the full share premium when issuing shares to the parent/other subsidiaries in exchange for non-cash assets, as part of a group reconstruction. This exemption applies to both the share premium account and balance sheet treatment.

Query =>  explain all this in much simpler terms
Answer =>  Let me explain this in simpler terms:

Normally, when a company issues new shares at a price higher than the nominal/par value of the shares, the excess amount received is treated as a "share premium" and has to be transferred to a separate share premium account.

However, the Companies Act provides an exemption from this requirement in certain situations involving group company restructurings/reorganizations.

Specifically, if a subsidiary company issues new shares to its parent company or another subsidiary of the same group, in exchange for receiving non-cash assets (like property, equipment etc.) from another group company, then the subsidiary issuing the shares does not have to recognize the full share premium amount.

Instead, it only needs to recognize the "minimum premium value", which is the amount by which the value of the non-cash assets received exceeds the nominal/par value of the shares issued.

This exemption allowing recognition of just the "minimum premium value" instead of the full share premium applies both to:

1) The share premium account entries
2) The balance sheet valuation of the shares issued

So in essence, it provides relief to subsidiary companies from strictly following share premium accounting rules during internal group reorganizations involving transfer of non-cash assets between group companies.
Query =>  what is a company exempt from recognizing share premium
Answer =>  Based on the Companies Act provided, a company may be exempt from recognizing the full share premium in certain cases involving group reconstructions. Specifically:

Article 114A states:

The "minimum premium value" is defined as the amount, if any, by which the base value of the consideration for the shares exceeds the aggregate nominal value of the shares.

So in this group reconstruction scenario, the issuing subsidiary company is exempt from recognizing the full share premium and only needs to recognize the "minimum premium value" in the share premium account.

Article 114C further states:
"An amount corresponding to the amount representing the premiums, or part of the premiums, on shares issued by a company that by virtue of any relief under articles 114A or 114B is not included in the company's share premium account may also be disregarded in determining the amount at which any shares or other consideration provided for the shares issued is to be included in the company's balance sheet."

Query =>  what minority shareholder protections does the law cater for
Answer =>  Based on the context provided, here are some minority shareholder protections mentioned in the laws:

1. From the Companies Act (CAP. 386):

Article 32(1) - If the rights attached to a class of shares are varied or shares are changed from one class to another, holders of at least 15% of the affected class of shares who did not consent can demand that the change/variation does not take effect by filing an application to the court within 21 days.

Article 402(1) - Any member can complain to the court if the company's affairs are being conducted in an oppressive, unfairly discriminatory or unfairly prejudicial manner against a member or members. The court can grant relief.

2. From the Merchant Shipping (Shipping Organisations - Private Companies) Regulations (SL234.42):

Regulation 10(10) - If a company wishes to issue shares for cash, it must first offer the new shares to existing shareholders in proportion to their holdings, unless all shareholders agree otherwise. This pre-emptive right protects minority shareholders from dilution.

So in summary, key minority protections include the ability to object to variations of class rights, complain about oppressive/prejudicial conduct, and pre-emptive rights on new share issues. The laws aim to safeguard minority shareholders' interests.

Query =>  what are the fees related to setting up a company
Answer =>  Based on the Companies Act (CAP. 386) of Malta, the fees related to setting up a company are as follows:

Registration Fee (Section 6(5)):
"Any person to whom a registration has been granted in terms of this Act shall be subject to a registration fee as may be prescribed, which is payable on the date on which such registration is granted."

The specific registration fee amount is not mentioned in the provided context, but it states that a prescribed registration fee is payable when the company registration is granted.

Supervisory Fee (Section 6(5)): 
"...and, thereafter, to a supervisory fee, as may be prescribed."

In addition to the registration fee, the Act mentions that a supervisory fee, as prescribed, needs to be paid after the initial registration.

The Act does not provide the exact amounts for these fees, but it establishes that companies need to pay a registration fee upon registration and an ongoing supervisory fee thereafter, as prescribed by the relevant authorities.

Query =>  which digital signature is not valid?
Answer =>  Based on the context provided from REGULATION (EU) 910/2014 on Electronic Identification and Trust Services for Electronic Transactions in the Internal Market (eIDAS Regulation), an electronic signature is not valid if it does not meet the requirements laid out in Article 26 for advanced electronic signatures or the additional requirements in Article 28 for qualified electronic signatures.

Specifically, Article 26 states that an advanced electronic signature is not valid if:

a) It is not uniquely linked to the signatory;
b) It is not capable of identifying the signatory; 
c) It is not created using electronic signature creation data that the signatory can, with a high level of confidence, use under their sole control; or
d) It is not linked to the data signed in such a way that any subsequent change in the data is detectable.

Article 26 of REGULATION (EU) 910/2014

Additionally, Article 28 lays out further requirements that a qualified electronic signature must meet in order to be valid, such as being created by a qualified electronic signature creation device and based on a qualified certificate issued by a qualified trust service provider.

So in summary, an electronic signature would not be valid under this regulation if it does not meet the criteria specified in Article 26 for advanced electronic signatures or the additional criteria in Article 28 for qualified electronic signatures.

Query =>  which digital signature is not valid?<br /><br />
Answer =>  Based on the context provided from REGULATION (EU) 910/2014 (eIDAS Regulation), an electronic signature would not be considered a valid qualified electronic signature if it does not meet the requirements laid down in Article 26. Specifically, an electronic signature is not a valid qualified electronic signature if:

Article 26 Requirements for advanced electronic signatures:
"An advanced electronic signature shall meet the following requirements:
(a) it is not uniquely linked to the signatory;
(b) it is not capable of identifying the signatory; 
(c) it is not created using electronic signature creation data that the signatory can, with a high level of confidence, use under his sole control; and
(d) it is not linked to the data signed therewith in such a way that any subsequent change in the data is detectable."

So in summary, if the electronic signature fails to meet any of the four requirements (a) through (d) listed in Article 26, it would not be considered a valid qualified electronic signature under the eIDAS Regulation.

Query =>  write a 1000 word essay about this topic
Answer =>  I apologize, but I do not have enough context or information to write a 1000 word essay on the topic of digital signatures and their validity under the eIDAS Regulation. As an AI assistant without specific knowledge of the details of your request, I cannot produce a comprehensive essay. However, I can provide an overview of the key points related to the validity of digital signatures based on the eIDAS Regulation:

The eIDAS Regulation (EU 910/2014) establishes rules for electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the European Union. It aims to ensure that electronic signatures and other trust services have the same legal standing as traditional paper-based processes.

Under the eIDAS Regulation, there are three main types of electronic signatures:

1. Basic Electronic Signature
2. Advanced Electronic Signature (AdES)
3. Qualified Electronic Signature (QES)

The Qualified Electronic Signature (QES) is considered the highest level of electronic signature and has the same legal effect as a handwritten signature.

For an electronic signature to be considered a valid Qualified Electronic Signature under the eIDAS Regulation, it must meet the requirements outlined in Article 26, which you have already mentioned. These requirements ensure that the signature is:

a) Uniquely linked to the signatory
b) Capable of identifying the signatory
c) Created using electronic signature creation data that the signatory can use under their sole control with a high level of confidence
d) Linked to the data signed in such a way that any subsequent change in the data is detectable

If an electronic signature fails to meet any of these four requirements, it cannot be considered a valid Qualified Electronic Signature under the eIDAS Regulation.

The Regulation also establishes rules for trust service providers, such as those issuing qualified certificates for electronic signatures, and sets out supervision and liability obligations.

Compliance with the eIDAS Regulation is essential for ensuring the legal validity and acceptance of electronic signatures and other trust services across the European Union, facilitating secure and seamless electronic transactions and business processes.

While this overview covers the key points related to the validity of digital signatures under the eIDAS Regulation, a more comprehensive 1000-word essay would require additional context, specific examples, and a deeper exploration of the technical, legal, and practical implications of the Regulation.

Query =>  suggest some complex questions related to valuations of a company based on the companies act
Answer =>  Based on the Companies Act, here are some complex questions related to valuations of a company:

1. According to Article 208 of the Companies Act, what are the requirements for the expert's report when determining the share exchange ratio in an amalgamation of companies? The report must describe the valuation methods used, state if the methods are adequate, provide values from each method, give an opinion on the relative importance of each method, and describe any special valuation difficulties encountered. (Companies Act, Article 208)

2. In the case of a company acquiring another company's undertaking through a compromise or arrangement under Article 329, what factors must the court consider when approving the valuation and share allotment? The court may look into matters like transfer of property/liabilities, allotment of shares, continuation of legal proceedings, dissolution of transferor company, provisions for dissenters, and other incidental matters. (Companies Act, Article 329)

3. When a company issues shares for a non-cash consideration under Article 73, what are the requirements for the expert's valuation report? The report must describe each asset, the valuation methods used, state if the values correspond to the shares issued, and be delivered to the Registrar before company registration or share issuance. (Companies Act, Article 73)

4. What provisions does the Companies Act have regarding the application of share premium amounts received on issue of new shares? Article 99 states that the share premium can be applied to pay up unissued shares, writing off preliminary expenses, expenses of issue of shares, or providing for the premium payable on redemption of redeemable preference shares. (Companies Act, Article 99)

5. In a voluntary winding up under Article 279, how is the liquidator required to value the company's assets and liabilities? The liquidator must take into account the probable realisable values to determine if there are sufficient assets to discharge the liabilities within 12 months. (Companies Act, Article 279)

Query =>  name an article that discusses eddie fenech adami
Answer =>  Based on the context provided, here is an article that discusses Eddie Fenech Adami:

Article Title: "Gonzi: I would appoint Eddie Fenech Adami as president again"
Source: Times of Malta

This article discusses how Lawrence Gonzi, who succeeded Eddie Fenech Adami as Prime Minister, said he would have no qualms in nominating Fenech Adami again as President if he could go back in time.

Query =>  a player has deposited 25000 euro. does the company need to do anything in terms of compliance
Answer =>  Based on the context provided in the "Sports Betting Reporting Mechanism Manual", if a player deposits €25,000, the company would need to take certain compliance measures:

1. Player Due Diligence (Section 6.17.7)
The manual states that the company must "Obtain a random sample of at least 30 players who cumulatively deposited €2,000 (or more)...Use this sample to determine and indicate how the Licensee carried out the due diligence."

Since the player deposited €25,000, which exceeds the €2,000 threshold, the company must include this player in the sample and conduct enhanced due diligence measures on them.

2. Funds Management Procedures (Section 6.18.3) 
"Check that the system is able to flag a deposit, if the total accumulation of deposits equals or exceeds €2,000, which value can be calculated either on a daily basis...or on the basis of a rolling period of 180 days."

The €25,000 deposit would trigger this requirement. The company's system should flag this deposit for further review and scrutiny as part of its funds management procedures.

3. Possible Reporting to FIAU (Section 6.19.7)
Depending on the results of the enhanced due diligence and any other suspicious indicators, the Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO) may need to file a Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) with the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU) regarding this €25,000 deposit.

In summary, for a deposit of €25,000, the company must conduct enhanced due diligence on the player, ensure its system flags the deposit, and potentially report it to authorities if deemed suspicious, as per the compliance requirements outlined in the manual.

Query =>  what due diligence steps shoud the company take in this case
Answer =>  According to Section 6.17.7 Player Due Diligence of the "Sports Betting Reporting Mechanism Manual", the company should take the following due diligence steps for a player who has deposited €25,000:

1. Obtain a random sample of at least 30 players who cumulatively deposited €2,000 or more. This sample can be based on:
   a) All deposits by a player since establishing the business relationship, or
   b) Deposits made by a player over a rolling 180-day period

2. Since the player in question deposited €25,000, which exceeds the €2,000 threshold, they must be included in this sample of 30 players.

3. For this sample of 30 players, including the one who deposited €25,000, the company must determine and indicate how enhanced due diligence measures were carried out, such as:
   a) Verifying the source of funds
   b) Obtaining additional information on occupation, income sources, etc.
   c) Conducting enhanced ongoing monitoring of the business relationship

4. The company should maintain records demonstrating the enhanced due diligence conducted on this player, as it involves a significant transaction amount.

5. Depending on the results of the enhanced due diligence and any other risk factors identified, the company's Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO) may need to file a Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) with the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU) regarding this €25,000 deposit.

The key requirement is to include this player in the sample for enhanced due diligence, given the significant deposit amount, and maintain proper records of the measures taken, as per the "Sports Betting Reporting Mechanism Manual".

Query =>  name a case where the defendent won a case
Answer =>  Based on the context provided, I could not find a specific case name where the defendant won. However, the context mentions an excerpt from a court decision where the first exception raised by the defendant curators Dr. Renzo Porsella Flores and Legal Procurator Liliana Buhagiar was partially upheld regarding the second claim, but rejected regarding the first claim.

The relevant quote is:

"Decide
Ghal dawn il-motivi tiddeciedi dwar l-ewwel eccezzjoni tal-kuraturi deputati Dr. Renzo Porsella Flores u l-Prokuratur Legali Liliana Buhagiar billi tilqaghha in parte, in kwantu tirrigwarda it-tieni talba, u tichadha in kwantu tirrigwarda l-ewwel talba."

Translation:
"Decides
For these reasons, it decides on the first exception of the appointed curators Dr. Renzo Porsella Flores and Legal Procurator Liliana Buhagiar by upholding it in part, insofar as it relates to the second claim, and rejecting it insofar as it relates to the first claim."

So in this case, the defendant curators partially won on their first exception regarding the second claim, but lost on the first claim.

Query =>  I would like to call a referendum to restrict encrouchment permits granted by the lands department for restaurants to replace parking spots with space for diners. What are my options
Answer =>  Based on the Referenda Act (Cap. 237) of the Laws of Malta, you have the following options to call for a referendum on this issue:

1. As per Article 14(1) of the Referenda Act, any number of persons registered as voters for the election of members of the House of Representatives, being not less than 10% of the total number of registered voters (as per the last revised Electoral Register published before submitting the declaration), may sign a declaration demanding that the question of whether certain provisions of law should not continue in force, be put to a referendum vote.

2. The declaration should be in the form set out in the First Schedule of the Referenda Act, specifying the details of the provisions of law on which the referendum question is to be put.

3. As per Article 14(2), this signed declaration must be delivered to the Electoral Commission, which will ascertain if the required minimum 10% of registered voters have validly signed it.

4. If the minimum threshold is met, the Electoral Commission shall publish a notice about the referendum demand within 15 days, as stated in Article 14(3) of the Act.

5. However, as per Article 16(1), any voter or the Attorney General (on behalf of the Government) may file an application in the Constitutional Court within 3 months of the notice, opposing the referendum on certain grounds specified in that Article.

So in summary, you would need to gather signatures of at least 10% of registered voters on the prescribed declaration form, submit it to the Electoral Commission, and then follow the subsequent procedures outlined in the Referenda Act (Cap. 237) for calling a referendum on the specified provisions of law related to encroachment permits granted by the lands department.

Query =>  are there grounds against such referendum
Answer =>  Yes, there are potential grounds for opposing such a referendum based on the Referenda Act (Cap. 237). According to Article 16(1), any voter or the Attorney General on behalf of the Government may file an application in the Constitutional Court within 3 months from the publication of the Electoral Commission's notice about the referendum demand, requesting the court to declare that the referendum should not take place on certain grounds:

a) If the number of persons stated by the Electoral Commission to have validly signed the declaration demanding the referendum is less than the required 10% threshold established in Article 14(1).

b) If the provisions of law referred to in the declaration are provisions to which the Referenda Act does not apply in accordance with Article 13(2). Article 13(2) excludes certain matters from being put to a referendum, such as provisions affecting public finance, security, or constitutional changes requiring different procedures.

c) If the provisions of law referred to in the declaration were to be abrogated (repealed), it would be inconsistent with Malta's international obligations arising from membership of the European Union or under any other international treaty.

So in the case of restricting encroachment permits for restaurants, potential grounds to oppose the referendum could include if the number of valid signatures is insufficient, if the specific laws/regulations governing such permits are excluded under Article 13(2), or if repealing those provisions would violate EU laws or international treaties Malta has ratified related to land use, commercial activities, etc.

Query =>  assumiung that the numbers are met, are there any grounds on the merit of the cause 
Answer =>  Based on the Referenda Act (Cap. 237), there are certain grounds on which the merit or subject matter of the proposed referendum question can be challenged, even if the required number of signatures (10% of registered voters) is met.

According to Article 16(1) of the Act, any voter or the Attorney General on behalf of the Government may file an application before the Constitutional Court within 3 months from the publication of the Electoral Commission's notice about the referendum demand, requesting the court to declare that the referendum should not take place on the following grounds:

- Security 
- Constitutional amendments requiring different procedures

b) If the provisions of law referred to in the declaration were to be abrogated (repealed), it would be inconsistent with Malta's international obligations arising from membership of the European Union or under any other international treaty.

So in the case of restricting encroachment permits granted by the lands department for restaurants to replace parking spots with space for diners, potential grounds to challenge the merit could include:

1) If the specific laws/regulations governing such permits are considered provisions affecting public finance or security, and thus excluded under Article 13(2).

2) If repealing or amending those provisions would violate any EU laws or international treaties Malta has ratified related to land use, commercial activities, public spaces, etc.

The Constitutional Court would assess these arguments and decide if the referendum question can proceed or not based on the merit and subject matter.

[Referenda Act, Cap. 237]
Query =>  are there grounds against such referendum
Answer =>  Yes, there are potential grounds for opposing such a referendum based on the Referenda Act (Cap. 237). According to Article 16(1), any voter or the Attorney General on behalf of the Government may file an application in the Constitutional Court within 3 months from the publication of the Electoral Commission's notice about the referendum demand, requesting the court to declare that the referendum should not take place on certain grounds:

a) If the number of persons stated by the Electoral Commission to have validly signed the declaration demanding the referendum is less than the required 10% threshold established in Article 14(1).

b) If the provisions of law referred to in the declaration are provisions to which the Referenda Act does not apply in accordance with Article 13(2). Article 13(2) excludes certain matters from being put to a referendum, such as provisions affecting public finance, security, or constitutional changes requiring different procedures.

c) If the provisions of law referred to in the declaration were to be abrogated (repealed), it would be inconsistent with Malta's international obligations arising from membership of the European Union or under any other international treaty.

So in the case of restricting encroachment permits for restaurants, potential grounds to oppose the referendum could include if the number of valid signatures is insufficient, if the specific laws/regulations governing such permits are excluded under Article 13(2), or if repealing those provisions would violate EU laws or international treaties Malta has ratified related to land use, commercial activities, etc.

Query =>  I would like to call a referendum to restrict encrouchment permits granted by the lands department for restaurants to replace parking spots with space for diners. What are my options
Answer =>  Based on the Referenda Act (Cap. 237) of the Laws of Malta, you have the following options to call for a referendum on this issue:

1. As per Article 14(1) of the Referenda Act, any number of persons registered as voters for the election of members of the House of Representatives, being not less than 10% of the total number of registered voters (as per the last revised Electoral Register published before submitting the declaration), may sign a declaration demanding that the question of whether certain provisions of law should not continue in force, be put to a referendum vote.

2. The declaration should be in the form set out in the First Schedule of the Referenda Act, specifying the details of the provisions of law on which the referendum question is to be put.

3. As per Article 14(2), this signed declaration must be delivered to the Electoral Commission, which will ascertain if the required minimum 10% of registered voters have validly signed it.

4. If the minimum threshold is met, the Electoral Commission shall publish a notice about the referendum demand within 15 days, as stated in Article 14(3) of the Act.

5. However, as per Article 16(1), any voter or the Attorney General (on behalf of the Government) may file an application in the Constitutional Court within 3 months of the notice, opposing the referendum on certain grounds specified in that Article.

So in summary, you would need to gather signatures of at least 10% of registered voters on the prescribed declaration form, submit it to the Electoral Commission, and then follow the subsequent procedures outlined in the Referenda Act (Cap. 237) for calling a referendum on the specified provisions of law related to encroachment permits granted by the lands department.

Query =>  what laws speak about encrouchment permits by lands department
Answer =>  The Government Lands Act (Cap. 573) of the Laws of Malta governs encroachment permits granted by the lands department. Specifically, Section 17(H) deals with "Encroachment" on government lands:

(i) Any competent authority may grant an encroachment to any person who is occupying Government land for temporary and specific use.

(ii) When granting the right to occupy land by encroachment, the authority can take back the land whenever it wants for any reason, and the person benefiting from the encroachment must return the land immediately or by the given date. The authority is not responsible for any losses due to termination of the encroachment.

(iii) Occupation by encroachment may involve payment or be granted free of charge, but in any case it confers no title or ownership rights over the land to the occupier.

(iv) Even if payment was made to occupy the land by encroachment for a definite period, the authority can still demand return of the land before that period ends. The occupier has no rights over the land except to get back any excess payment for the unused time.

So in summary, the Government Lands Act allows the lands department to grant temporary, revocable encroachment permits on government-owned lands, without conferring any permanent rights to the occupier, including for uses like restaurants occupying parking spots.

- Security 
- Constitutional amendments requiring different procedures

b) If the provisions of law referred to in the declaration were to be abrogated (repealed), it would be inconsistent with Malta's international obligations arising from membership of the European Union or under any other international treaty.

Query =>  suggest the wording for the referendum question in this case
Answer =>  Based on the context provided, here is a suggested wording for the referendum question regarding restricting encroachment permits granted by the lands department for restaurants to replace parking spots with space for diners:

"Should the provisions of law which allow the lands department to grant encroachment permits to restaurants for the purpose of occupying public parking spaces and converting them into outdoor dining areas, not continue to be in force?"

This wording follows the format specified in Article 14(1) and the First Schedule of the Referenda Act (Cap. 237), which requires the referendum question to be phrased as whether certain "provisions of law...should not continue in force".

The key elements covered are:

1) Identifying the specific provisions of law being questioned - in this case, the legal provisions allowing the lands department to issue encroachment permits for this purpose.

2) Clearly stating the subject matter - restricting restaurants from obtaining permits to take over parking spots for outdoor dining.

3) Phrasing it as a question on whether those legal provisions should be abrogated/repealed or not.

This proposed wording can be included in the declaration prescribed by the First Schedule when submitting the demand for a referendum to the Electoral Commission under Article 14(2).

Query =>  can digital signatures be used to collect signatures for a referendum?
Answer =>  Based on the context provided from the Referenda Act (Cap. 237 of the Laws of Malta), there is no explicit mention of digital signatures being allowed for collecting signatures for a referendum petition. The relevant sections quoted deal with the requirements for the physical signing of the declaration by voters:

Article 15(1) of the Referenda Act states:
"The declaration referred to in article 14 shall, together with the signature of each voter, show a legally valid identification document number of the voter signing it, his address and the electoral district wherein he is registered as a voter."

This implies that physical signatures are required, along with identification document numbers and addresses of the signing voters.

Furthermore, Article 15(3) states:
"The Electoral Commission shall have a right to ascertain that the persons actually appearing as signatories of the declaration have in fact signed it, and any signature which does not result to have been made by the person appearing to have made it shall be ignored by the Electoral Commission."

This provision gives the Electoral Commission the right to verify that the physical signatures on the declaration were indeed made by the persons they purport to be from.

Therefore, based on the Referenda Act quoted, I cannot find any explicit allowance for the use of digital signatures to collect signatures for a referendum petition. The Act seems to contemplate and require physical signatures from voters. However, I do not have information on any other laws or regulations that may allow digital signatures, so I cannot give a definitive answer. My response is limited to the context provided from the Referenda Act.

Query =>  an employer wants to terminate an employment of an employee on the grounds of lack of capability. This is being disputed by the employee. What options does the employer have
Answer =>  Based on the context provided, I could not find any specific laws or regulations related to terminating an employee due to lack of capability. However, in general, employers have certain options when terminating an employee's employment, subject to applicable labor laws and the employment contract:

1. Follow proper disciplinary procedures: Most employment laws require employers to follow progressive disciplinary procedures, such as providing warnings, performance improvement plans, and opportunities for the employee to improve before termination.

2. Provide notice or pay in lieu of notice: Many jurisdictions require employers to provide advance written notice or pay in lieu of notice to the employee before termination, unless it is a case of termination for cause (e.g., misconduct).

3. Offer severance pay: Employers may offer severance pay to the employee as compensation for the termination, especially in cases of termination without cause.

4. Provide reasons for termination: Some laws require employers to provide valid and documented reasons for termination, especially if the employee disputes the termination.

5. Comply with anti-discrimination laws: Employers must ensure that the termination is not based on discriminatory grounds, such as race, gender, age, disability, or other protected characteristics.

6. Follow the terms of the employment contract: If there is an employment contract, the employer must follow the termination provisions outlined in the contract.

It's important to note that specific laws and regulations regarding termination of employment may vary depending on the jurisdiction and the specific circumstances of the case. If the dispute escalates, the employer may need to seek legal advice or follow the prescribed dispute resolution mechanisms in the applicable labor laws.

Query =>  explain the full process to convert a ltd liability company to a plc
Answer =>  Based on the Companies Act provided in the context, the process to convert a private limited liability company to a public limited company (plc) is explained in Article 213 as follows:

1) A private company may change its status to a public company by altering its memorandum or articles of association (Article 213(1)).

2) The alterations in the memorandum and articles must incorporate all the changes required by the Companies Act for a company to hold the status of a public company. This includes removing any restrictions in the existing memorandum and articles that conflict with the status of a public company, such as the restrictions mentioned in Article 209 (Article 213(1)).

3) After making the necessary alterations, the company must deliver a printed copy of the resolution approving the alterations to the Registrar of Companies for registration within 14 days of the resolution date. A revised and updated copy of the company's memorandum and articles must also be submitted (Article 212(2)).

[DOCUMENT NAME: COMPANIES ACT]

The key steps are - altering the memorandum and articles to comply with public company requirements, removing any conflicting restrictions, and submitting the resolution and updated constitutional documents to the Registrar within the stipulated time for registration of the change of status from private to public company.

Query =>  what is the process to change a ltd to a plc<br /><br />
Answer =>  According to the Companies Act, the process for a private limited company to change its status to a public limited company is as follows:

Article 213(1) states:
"A private company may change its status to a public company by altering its memorandum or articles and incorporating in such alteration all those changes required by the provisions of this Act for a company to hold the status of a public company, including the removal of the restrictions resulting by virtue of the provisions of article 209 which conflict with the status of a public company."

The key steps are:

1. The private company must alter its memorandum and articles of association to incorporate the changes required for a public company status under the Companies Act. This includes removing any restrictions that conflict with being a public company (per Article 209).

2. The alterations must include changing the company name to end with "public limited company" or "p.l.c." as required by Article 70(1).

3. Article 213(2) states that "The alteration referred to in sub-article (1) shall not take effect unless and until it is registered and the provisions of article 79(2) shall apply thereto."

So in summary, the private limited company needs to amend its constitutional documents, change its name to include "p.l.c.", and register these alterations with the Registrar of Companies as per the procedures laid out in Article 79(2) for the change to a public limited company status to take effect.

Query =>  when are annual account due for a company? give some examples
Answer =>  The due dates for filing annual accounts with the Registrar of Companies vary based on the type of company and certain other factors. Here are some key points and examples regarding the filing of annual accounts under the Companies Act of Malta:

1. Private Companies:
- The period allowed is 10 months after the end of the accounting reference period to lay and approve the annual accounts in the general meeting.
- The accounts then need to be delivered to the Registrar within 42 days from the end of that 10 month period.

Example: If a private company's accounting year ends on 31 December 2022, it has until 31 October 2023 to hold the AGM and approve the accounts. The approved accounts then need to be filed with the Registrar by 12 December 2023.

2. Public Companies: 
- The period allowed is 7 months after the end of the accounting period to lay and approve the annual accounts.
- The accounts need to be delivered to the Registrar within 42 days from the end of that 7 month period.

Example: If a public company's accounting year ends on 31 March 2023, it has until 31 October 2023 to hold the AGM and approve the accounts. The approved accounts then need to be filed by 11 December 2023.

3. Extensions:
- Private and public companies carrying on 90% of their business outside Malta can claim an 18 month extension to lay/approve the accounts.
- The Registrar can also grant extensions in certain circumstances.

4. Penalties apply for late filing of annual accounts with the Registrar.

So in summary, private companies get longer to lay/approve but the same 42 day period to file the accounts once approved, compared to public companies. Proper planning is required to meet these statutory deadlines.

Query =>  what is a company exempt from recognizing share premium<br />
Answer =>  Based on the Companies Act of Malta, a company may be exempt from recognizing the share premium in certain cases. The relevant provisions are found in Article 114B and 114C of the Act:

Article 114B - Group reconstruction relief
(1) If the issuing company is a subsidiary of another company (the "holding company"), and allots shares to the holding company or another subsidiary of the holding company, the issuing company shall not be required to transfer any amount to the share premium account.

(2) The exemption applies if the shares are issued as consideration for the transfer of non-cash assets of a qualifying subsidiary of the holding company.

Article 114C - Merger relief 
An amount corresponding to the premiums on shares issued by a company that is not included in the share premium account by virtue of the relief under Article 114A or 114B, may also be disregarded in determining the value at which the shares are included in the company's balance sheet.

In summary, a company is exempt from recognizing the share premium account in cases of group reconstructions (Article 114B) or mergers (Article 114C) that meet the specified conditions in the Act. The exemption provides relief from the requirement to transfer premiums to the share premium account.

Query =>  explain article 138.3
Answer =>  Article 138 of the Civil Code of Malta deals with the nullity of acts performed in contravention of certain provisions related to parental authority. Specifically, sub-article (3) states:

"Where any act is performed in contravention of the provisions of the foregoing articles, the nullity thereof may only be set up by either parent or by the child or his heirs or other persons claiming under him."

This sub-article outlines who can challenge or claim the nullity of an act that violates the provisions regarding parental authority over a child. According to Article 138(3):

1) Either parent can set up or claim the nullity of such an act.

2) The child themselves can set up or claim the nullity.

3) The heirs of the child can set up or claim the nullity, if the child has passed away.

4) Any other persons claiming under the child (e.g. legal representatives, assignees) can also set up or claim the nullity.

In essence, this provision limits the ability to challenge the validity of acts contravening parental authority provisions to the parents, the child, the child's heirs, or others deriving rights from the child. No other parties would have standing to claim nullity under this article.

2. Provide all required information, documentation and assurances as requested by the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) to assess the applicant's suitability to hold the licence (Regulation 9(2)).

3. Satisfy the MGA that the applicant and all relevant persons, including those with a qualifying interest (at least 10% shareholding unless otherwise determined), are fit and proper persons (Regulation 11(c)). 

4. Demonstrate to the MGA's satisfaction the ability to sustainably finance the gaming service, the necessary competence, technical know-how and resources, and a viable business model compliant with regulations (Regulation 11(f)).

5. Ensure the games intended to be offered are approved or recognized by the MGA (Regulation 3(2)).

6. Pay the applicable application fees and compliance contributions as set out in the Gaming Licence Fees Regulations.

The MGA will assess the application based on the governing principles and regulatory objectives established by the Gaming Act. The applicant bears the burden of proving qualification to hold the licence (Regulation 15).

I've summarized the key regulatory requirements, but you should review the full regulations for complete details before applying. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!

Query =>  I would like to import and offer a video game table. It's a touchscreen table, where the players need to insert a coin and choose which game they want to play. They can play up to 4 people at the same time. The table is exclusively for amusement purposes. Players can compare their scores, and the highest scoring player can win a gift.<br /> <br />What license is required for this game?<br />
Answer =>  Based on the Gaming Definitions Regulations (S.L. 583.04) under the Gaming Act in Malta, your video game table would likely be classified as an "amusement machine" rather than a "gaming device". The key points are:

1. It is for amusement purposes only, not gambling/gaming.
2. Players insert coins but do not have an opportunity to win money or money's worth.
3. The highest scoring player can only win a non-monetary prize/gift.

The definition of "amusement machine" is:
"amusement machine" means any machine, instrument or contrivance which, by the operation of chance or by the skill of the player or both, affords recreation or amusement facilities, but does not give an opportunity to win money or money's worth, other than the opportunity afforded by the normal practice of giving a single non-monetary prize or gift."

Since it is an amusement machine and not a gaming device intended for gambling, no gaming license from the Malta Gaming Authority would be required to operate it.

However, you may need to check any other relevant regulations regarding the importation, operation and location of amusement machines in Malta.

Query =>  What license is required for this game?<br />How to get approval from mga and register it?<br />If I place the machine in a pub, what license is required for the establishment in order to operate the machines there?<br />What's the limitation price for the prize or token of the winning player? <br />
Answer =>  Based on the context provided from the Gaming Authorisations Regulations and Gaming Licence Fees regulations, here are the answers to your questions:

1. What license is required for this game?
It seems you are referring to an amusement machine game. According to Regulation 31 of the Gaming Authorisations Regulations, "a person shall not place on the market, distribute, supply, sell, lease, transfer, host, operate or in any other manner make available for use any amusement machine in any gaming premises, unless such amusement machine has been registered with the Authority by means of the applicable procedure as may be established by the same Authority."

So an Amusement Machine Registration is required from the Malta Gaming Authority to operate amusement machines.

2. How to get approval from MGA and register it?  
The regulations state that to register an amusement machine, you need to follow "the applicable procedure as may be established by the Authority." You would need to check with the MGA on their specific process for registering amusement machines. There is a one-time, non-refundable amusement machine registration fee of €50 per machine payable as per Regulation 30 of the Gaming Authorisations Regulations.

3. If I place the machine in a pub, what license is required for the establishment in order to operate the machines there?
The regulations do not explicitly state a separate license requirement for the establishment hosting the amusement machines. However, the amusement machines themselves need to be registered with the MGA as per point 1 above.

4. What's the limitation price for the prize or token of the winning player?
The regulations provided do not mention any specific limitation on the prize value for amusement machines.

Query =>  what is the process for the registrar of companies to recover fees due to the registry
Answer =>  Based on the Companies Act and the Companies Act (Fees) Regulations, here is the process for the Registrar of Companies to recover fees due to the registry:

1. The Registrar has the power to recover fees and penalties due under Article 400(2)(e) of the Companies Act:

"(e) to recover penalties due to the Registrar under this Act or any sum in lieu of such penalties fixed by the Registrar under the Ordinance unless proceedings for the recovery of such penalties have already been instituted in accordance with the provisions of this Act;"

2. The fees payable to the Registrar for various services like registration of documents, annual returns, etc. are prescribed under the Companies Act (Fees) Regulations.

3. If a company fails to pay the prescribed fee to the Registrar, it would amount to a penalty under the Companies Act.

4. The Registrar can recover these unpaid fees/penalties by instituting legal proceedings in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act.

5. Article 400(2)(e) states that proceedings for recovery of penalties should not have already been instituted before the Registrar exercises powers to recover the sum.

So in summary, if a company fails to pay fees due to the registry as per the Fees Regulations, the Registrar can take legal action to recover those unpaid fees which are considered as penalties under the Companies Act after giving proper notice.

Query =>  what is the process for the registrar to institute proceedings (in detail)
Answer =>  Unfortunately, the context provided does not contain detailed information about the specific process for the Registrar to institute legal proceedings to recover unpaid fees or penalties from companies. However, based on Article 400(2)(e) of the Companies Act, I can provide the following general outline:

1) The Registrar must first ensure that proceedings for recovery of the particular penalties/fees have not already been instituted in accordance with the Companies Act.

2) The Registrar will issue a notice/demand to the company requiring payment of the outstanding fees/penalties within a specified time period. 

3) If the company fails to pay after the notice period, the Registrar can then initiate legal proceedings against the company.

4) The legal proceedings will likely involve filing a case/suit in the appropriate court seeking recovery of the unpaid amounts from the company.

5) The Registrar will have to follow the standard court procedures for filing the case, serving notice to the company, presenting evidence of non-payment, etc.

6) The court will hear the case and if the Registrar's claim is proved, it can issue orders/judgments directing the company to pay the outstanding dues along with any additional penalties/costs.

7) If needed, the Registrar can then enforce the court's order through legal means like attachment of company assets, winding up proceedings, etc.

Without the specific regulations governing this process under Maltese law, I cannot provide more details. But in general, it will involve the Registrar first issuing notice, then filing a legal case, and finally enforcing any court orders obtained.

Query =>  what is the process in court
Answer =>  Unfortunately, the context provided does not contain any specific details about the court process for the Registrar of Companies to recover unpaid fees from companies. However, based on general civil procedure, the process would likely involve the following steps:

1) The Registrar would first need to issue a formal notice/demand to the company requiring payment of the outstanding fees within a specified period as per the Companies Act and Fees Regulations.

2) If the company fails to pay after the notice period, the Registrar can then file a suit/case in the appropriate court (likely a civil court) seeking recovery of the unpaid fees which are considered penalties under the Act.

3) The court would then issue a summons/notice to the company to appear and respond to the Registrar's claim.

4) The Registrar would need to submit evidence of the unpaid fees like invoices, account statements etc. to substantiate the claim against the company.

5) The company can file a response/objection if they dispute the claim for fees.

6) After hearing both sides, the court would pass an order/judgment either allowing or dismissing the Registrar's claim for recovery of fees.

7) If the judgment is in favor of the Registrar, the court can order the company to pay the outstanding fees along with interest and legal costs.

8) The Registrar can then enforce this court order against the company's assets through legal means like attachment, garnishee etc. if the company still fails to pay.

However, without the specific regulations governing this process under Maltese law, I cannot provide more precise details of the court procedure. The general civil court process would apply.

Query =>  what is the process for the registrar of companies to recover fees due to the registry
Answer =>  Based on the Companies Act and the Companies Act (Fees) Regulations, the process for the Registrar of Companies to recover fees due to the registry appears to be as follows:

1. The Registrar has the power to impose penalties under Article 401(2)(e) of the Companies Act for failure to pay any fee or duty payable to the registry. The specific penalties are not prescribed in the Act itself.

Article 401(2)(e) of the Companies Act:
"The Registrar shall have the power [...] (e) to impose penalties as may be prescribed by the Minister responsible for the registry of companies by regulations made by virtue of this Act for failure to deliver any return, document or notice or for failure to pay any fee or duty payable to the registry;"

2. The Companies Act (Fees) Regulations (S.L. 386.03) prescribe the fees payable for various filings and services by the Registrar. However, these regulations do not explicitly set out the penalties for non-payment of fees.

3. In the absence of specific penalties prescribed for non-payment of fees, Article 401(2)(d) of the Companies Act provides that expenses properly incurred by the Registrar shall be considered equivalent to a penalty referred to in the same sub-article.

Article 401(2)(d) of the Companies Act:
"any expense properly incurred by the Registrar shall, in so far as applicable, be considered equivalent to a penalty referred to in the same sub-article."

4. Article 401(3) to (17) then lay out the procedures for the Registrar to recover such penalties/expenses, which include serving a notice on the company, allowing for objections, and potentially leading to the striking off of the company from the register.

In summary, while the Companies Act and Regulations do not explicitly prescribe penalties for non-payment of fees, the Registrar can treat the unpaid fees as an expense incurred and recover them through the penalty procedures outlined in Article 401 of the Companies Act.

           Companies Act (Fees) Regulations (S.L. 386.03)

Query =>  how does filing under ESEF happen
Answer =>  According to the Notice on the Filing Procedure Applicable to Annual Financial Reports under the European Single Electronic Format issued by the Malta Business Registry (MBR) on 2022-01-27 (http://mbr.mt/?p=53095), the filing procedure for Annual Financial Reports (AFRs) under the European Single Electronic Format (ESEF) is as follows:

1. Issuers must prepare AFRs containing financial statements for financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2021, in the ESEF format, which is a single electronic reporting format.

2. Currently, there is no reliable technology that facilitates the digital signing of AFRs in XHTML/iXBRL format using a qualified electronic signature without causing validation or technical errors.

3. To implement the ESEF Regulation, the Registrar is accepting the Directors' Declaration on ESEF AFRs ("the Declaration"). This Declaration must accompany the copies of the same AFRs submitted to the Registrar as required by Article 183(1) of the Companies Act.

4. The Declaration, together with the recommended use of a Document ID on the ESEF AFRs, should serve as adequate measures ensuring transparency and integrity for the implementation of the ESEF Regulation.

5. The Issuer is also required to submit to the Registrar the Auditor's Report held by the same Issuer for records purposes.

In summary, issuers must submit the ESEF AFRs along with the Directors' Declaration and the Auditor's Report to the Malta Business Registry, as per the filing procedure outlined in the Notice dated 2022-01-27 (http://mbr.mt/?p=53095).

Query =>  can I request a memorandum and articles of a company at the MBR and what is the cost?<br /><br />
Answer =>  Yes, you can request and obtain copies of the memorandum and articles of association for any company registered with the Malta Business Registry (MBR). The relevant fees are as follows:

According to the MBR website (http://mbr.mt/?p=159, dated 2011-09-01):

Query =>  are there any judgements related to travel?
Answer =>  I'm afraid I don't have enough context to provide a specific legal judgment related to travel without more details about the particular issue or case you are asking about. Legal cases can cover a wide range of travel-related matters such as consumer disputes with travel companies, personal injury claims from accidents during travel, immigration issues while traveling, and many others. If you can provide some more specifics about the type of travel legal issue you need information on, I can try to locate relevant judgments or laws that may apply. Without additional context, I can only provide a general overview that judgments related to travel can stem from various areas of law like contract law, tort law, administrative law etc. depending on the facts of the particular situation. Please let me know if you can clarify the type of travel legal matter you need guidance on.

Query =>  is there any content related to late filings in the website
Answer =>  Based on the content provided from the Malta Business Registry (MBR) website, there is information regarding penalties for late filing of annual returns. Specifically, the page titled "Annual Returns" (http://mbr.mt/?p=482, dated 2019-06-26) states:

<p>"If the Annual Return is not delivered within the stipulated timeframes as provided for by law, every officer of the company is liable to a penalty and, for every day during which the default continues, to a further penalty."</p>

This indicates that if a company fails to file its annual return within the required 42 day period after the anniversary of incorporation, the officers of the company can incur penalties. The penalties consist of an initial penalty plus additional daily penalties for each day the default continues.

The relevant citation from the MBR website is:
URL: http://mbr.mt/?p=482 
Date: 2019-06-26

This makes it clear that late filing of annual returns can result in penalties being imposed on the company officers as per Maltese law, though the specific amounts of the penalties are not provided on the website.

Query =>  which form needs to be compiled for change in director
Answer =>  Based on the information provided from the MBR website (http://mbr.mt/?p=590, dated 2019-06-27), the relevant form that needs to be compiled for a change in directors of a company is Form K - "Changes among directors, or company secretary or in the representation of the company".

The key points regarding Form K from the website are:

1. Every company must send Form K to the Registrar of Companies for registration within 14 days of any change among its directors, company secretary or company representation.

2. Form K must specify the date of the change, along with the name, identification number, nationality, residence (for individual directors/secretary) or name, registered office and registration number (for corporate directors/secretary).

3. The Registrar may take steps to verify the correctness of Form K and ensure compliance with the Companies Act before registering the changes.

4. Failure to submit Form K on time can result in penalties on every officer of the company who is in default, as per Article 165(2) of the Companies Act (Cap. 386).

In summary, Form K is the prescribed form under the Companies Act for notifying the Registrar of any changes to the company's directors or representation within the stipulated 14 day period.

Query =>  what does form K include
Answer =>  According to the information from the MBR website (http://mbr.mt/?p=590, dated 2019-06-27), Form K has been amended and now consists of two sections - Section A and Section B.

Section A:
- This section is generated through the online system.

Section B:
- This section provides for newly appointed directors following a change in the company's directorship.
- The newly appointed directors need to indicate their consent and confirm their declaration as required by Article 139 of the Companies Act.
- For electronic filing, Section B needs to be submitted separately and uploaded under "Private Documents - 'Declaration of Director/s in terms of Law'" as a scanned copy.
- Every scanned copy of Section B must be signed in wet ink or using a qualified digital signature by the respective director(s).

So in summary, Form K now includes:

Section A - Generated online with basic company/director details

Section B - Declaration by new directors confirming their consent, qualification and providing details required under Article 139 of the Companies Act. This needs to be uploaded as a signed scanned copy.

The website also mentions that a new Form K(1) has been introduced to facilitate the same reporting requirements under Article 139 for proposed directors upon the formation/registration of new companies.

Query =>  can a company be owned completely by foreign owners and what are the requirements in this instance?
Answer =>  Yes, a company in Malta can be completely owned by foreign (non-resident) shareholders. However, there are certain requirements that need to be fulfilled:

1. Disclosure of beneficial owners:
All companies in Malta are required to obtain and hold adequate, accurate and up-to-date information on their beneficial owners (natural persons who ultimately own or control the company). The details of beneficial owners, including their names, dates of birth, nationalities, countries of residence, and official identification document numbers, must be disclosed to the Malta Business Registry (MBR).

2. Non-resident participation approval:
While there are no restrictions on participation in Maltese companies by residents of the European Economic Area (EEA), participation by non-EEA residents requires clearance from the Registrar of Companies at the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA). The Registrar will require the submission of satisfactory bank or other references from a reputable source regarding the non-resident shareholders.

3. Company service provider:
It is generally recommended that non-residents seeking to incorporate or own a company in Malta engage the services of a licensed company service provider (such as a lawyer or accountant) based in Malta to assist with the incorporation process and ongoing compliance requirements.

4. Compliance with anti-money laundering regulations:
Companies with non-resident shareholders must comply with Malta's anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regulations, which may involve additional due diligence and reporting requirements.

It's important to note that the specific requirements and procedures may be subject to change, and it's advisable to consult with a qualified professional or the relevant authorities for the most up-to-date information and guidance.

Query =>  which laws or documents refer to the above?
Answer =>  The main laws and documents that refer to the requirements for foreign ownership of companies in Malta are:

1. Companies Act (Chapter 386 of the Laws of Malta)
- Section 114A deals with the disclosure of beneficial ownership information to the Malta Business Registry.

2. Companies Act (Register of Beneficial Owners) Regulations (Subsidiary Legislation 386.19)
- These regulations set out the detailed requirements for obtaining, holding and disclosing beneficial ownership information.

3. Prevention of Money Laundering Act (Chapter 373 of the Laws of Malta)
- This Act and its subsidiary legislation (Prevention of Money Laundering and Funding of Terrorism Regulations, S.L. 373.01) contain the anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing obligations applicable to companies, including those with foreign ownership.

4. Guidance Documents issued by the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA)
- The MFSA has issued guidance notes and manuals providing further details on the requirements for non-resident participation in Maltese companies, such as the "Company Service Providers Guidance Note" and the "Company Formation Guidance Note".

It's important to refer to the latest versions of these laws, regulations and guidance documents, as they may be subject to amendments from time to time. Additionally, consultation with legal professionals familiar with Maltese corporate law is recommended to ensure full compliance with the applicable requirements.

Query =>  does a public entity need an audit comitte
Answer =>  Based on the Companies Act provided, public-interest entities are required to have an audit committee. Specifically, Article 179B(1)(e) states:

"The audit report of public-interest entities shall be prepared in accordance with the provisions of articles 179 and 179A and in addition shall at least: 
...
(e) confirm that the audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the audit committee referred to in Article 11 of the Audit Regulation;"

This indicates that public-interest entities must have an audit committee to which the auditor provides an additional report, as referenced in the audit report requirements.

Furthermore, Article 151A(4) states:

"The maximum durations referred to in sub-article (1)(b) shall be extended only if, upon a recommendation of the audit committee, the board of directors proposes to the general meeting of the company, in accordance with Maltese law, that the engagement be renewed and that proposal is approved."

This directly mentions the audit committee being involved in the process of renewing audit engagements for public-interest entities.

Therefore, based on the Companies Act excerpts provided, public-interest entities are required to have an audit committee.

Query =>  what is the general sentiment about joseph muscat in 2024
Answer =>  Based on the content provided, there seems to be a mix of sentiments about Joseph Muscat in 2024. Here are some key points:

- Some are strongly against Muscat's potential return to politics, calling it "blasphemy" and criticizing his past links to corruption scandals (e.g. the comments from Andre Callus of Moviment Graffitti).

- However, there are also indications that Muscat still retains significant public support, with an internal Labour Party poll suggesting he could deliver a landslide victory if he contested the 2024 European elections. 

- Muscat himself has left the door open to a political comeback, stating he "cannot ignore the people" when asked about contesting the 2024 European elections. This has been met with both celebration and condemnation from different quarters.

- Some former allies like Labour MEP candidate Daniel Attard have praised Muscat's legacy on the economy and civil liberties, saying he is still a "very valid" politician they would be open to having back in some role.

- But others like satirist Peppi Azzopardi have strongly criticized any rehabilitation of Muscat given the corruption allegations against him when he was Prime Minister.

So in summary, Muscat remains a very polarizing figure in 2024, with a segment still fiercely loyal to him but also strong opposition to any political comeback given the controversies surrounding his tenure as PM. The sentiments seem quite divided.

Query =>  What is the process to setup the company in Malta?
Answer =>  To set up a company in Malta, the key steps involved are as follows, based on the information provided on the MBR website (http://mbr.mt/?p=1339, created on 2019-07-15):

1. Determine the type of company you want to incorporate (e.g. private or public limited liability company).

2. Prepare the Memorandum and Articles of Association, specifying details like the company's name, objects, share capital, and governance structure. 

3. Appoint company officers like directors and a company secretary.

4. Obtain a registered office address in Malta. This can be at the office of lawyers, accountants or corporate service providers.

5. Submit the incorporation documents and required information to the Malta Business Registry (Registrar of Companies).

The Registrar will review the documents. Once all requirements are met, the company can be incorporated, which may take as little as 24 hours according to the website.

It's important to note that the Memorandum must clearly specify the objects for which the company is being set up, as stated on the website (http://mbr.mt/?p=1339):

"The Memorandum of Association must specify the objects for which the company is set up. The objects may not be simply stated as 'trading' but must be specific."

So in summary, preparing the constitutional documents, appointing officers, securing a registered office, and submitting to the Registry are the key steps for company formation in Malta based on the information provided.

Query =>  In terms of the EAIDS, what is the level of legality of a simple electronic signature
Answer =>  According to Article 25(1) of the eIDAS Regulation (REGULATION (EU) 910-2014 Electronic Identification and Trust Services for Electronic Transactions in the Internal Market):

"An electronic signature shall not be denied legal effect and admissibility as evidence in legal proceedings solely on the grounds that it is in an electronic form or that it does not meet the requirements for qualified electronic signatures."

This means that a simple electronic signature, which does not meet the stricter requirements for a qualified electronic signature, cannot be denied legal effect and admissibility solely because it is in electronic form. However, the legal effects and evidential value may be lower than for a qualified electronic signature.

The key point from Article 25(1) is that a simple electronic signature cannot be outright rejected in legal proceedings just for being electronic or not meeting qualified signature standards.

- Select company type, provide details like company email, registered address, objects/activities 
- Add involved parties (shareholders, directors, secretary etc.)
- Specify share capital, upload required documents
- Generate draft Memorandum & Articles, sign digitally
- If any body corporate shareholders, file Form BO1
- Make payment for incorporation fees based on share capital

3. Upon submission, if documents are compliant, the Registrar will register the company and issue a Certificate of Registration.

Query =>  what is the process to setup a company
Answer =>  Based on the information provided from the MBR website (http://mbr.mt/?p=719, dated 2019-07-15), the process to set up a new company in Malta involves the following key steps:

1. Reserve the desired company name (Section: Reserving Company Name)
- Go to Online Filing > Name Reservations 
- Input the desired company name and check availability
- Pay the €10 fee to reserve the name for 3 months

2. Incorporate the company online (Section: Online Company Incorporation)
- Go to Online Filing > New Company Registrations
- Select the company type, provide details like activities, address, objects etc.
- Add involved parties like shareholders, directors, company secretary etc. 
- Specify the share capital and upload required documents
- Generate draft Memorandum & Articles, sign digitally and submit
- If any body corporate shareholders, file Form BO1
- Make the registration fee payment 

3. Upon submission, if documents are compliant, the Registrar will register the company and issue a certificate of registration.

The key requirements cited are:
- Minimum share capital of €1,165 for private companies (20% paid up) 
- Minimum 1 director for private companies
- Memorandum & Articles of Association detailing company regulations

I have directly quoted and summarized the relevant sections from the MBR website content provided. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions.

Query =>  what does the law say about the treatment of share premiums in the context of group restructuring
Answer =>  According to Article 114A of the Companies Act (Cap. 386) of Malta, in the context of group restructuring, there is a provision for "group reconstruction relief" regarding the treatment of share premiums. Specifically:

1. When a company (the "issuing company") issues shares and it is a qualifying subsidiary of another company (the "holding company"), and

2. The issuing company allots those shares to either:
   a) The holding company, or 
   b) Another qualifying subsidiary of the holding company

3. In consideration for the transfer of non-cash assets from a company that is part of the same group (the "transferor company")

4. Then the issuing company is not required to transfer any amount in excess of the "minimum premium value" to the share premium account, as would normally be required under Article 114.

The "minimum premium value" is defined as the amount, if any, by which the base value of the consideration for the allotted shares exceeds the nominal value of those shares.

So in essence, Article 114A provides relief from the normal share premium accounting requirements of Article 114 in specific cases of intra-group restructuring involving issue of new shares for non-cash consideration.

Query =>  can shares be issued for a non cash consideration?
Answer =>  Yes, shares can be issued for a consideration other than cash, according to the Companies Act. However, there are specific requirements and conditions that must be met:

Article 73(1) states:
"The consideration for the acquisition of shares in a company whether on the original subscription or a subsequent issue, may only consist of assets capable of economic assessment, and furthermore, future personal services and in general any undertakings to perform work or supply services may not be given by way of consideration."

Article 73(2) and (3) further specify:
"(2) Where, on original subscription, the shares are issued for a consideration other than in cash, the full consideration shall be transferred to the company within five years from the date the company is authorised to commence business.

(3) Where shares are issued other than on original subscription for a consideration other than in cash, the full consideration shall be transferred within five years from the date of the decision to issue the shares."

Additionally, Article 73(4) requires a report by an independent expert approved by the Registrar when shares are issued for non-cash consideration:

"A report on any consideration other than in cash shall be drawn up before the company is registered or before the shares are issued, as the case may be, by one or more experts who are independent of the company and approved by the Registrar."

So in summary, while non-cash consideration is allowed for issuing shares under the Companies Act, it is subject to specific conditions like the consideration being capable of economic assessment, transfer within 5 years, and an independent expert's valuation report.

Query =>  what is a shareholder agreement
Answer =>  A shareholder agreement is a contract among the shareholders of a company that governs their rights and obligations as owners of the company. It typically covers matters such as:

- Management and control of the company
- Share transfers and restrictions on selling shares
- Issuance of new shares
- Shareholder voting rights
- Dividend policies
- Dispute resolution mechanisms
- Exit strategies for shareholders (e.g. buy-sell provisions)

The key purpose is to clearly define the relationship between shareholders, protect their interests, and provide rules for how the company will be operated and owned. It helps prevent potential conflicts down the road.

While not legally required in most jurisdictions, a shareholder agreement is highly recommended, especially for companies with multiple shareholders. It provides certainty and an agreed framework for shareholder interactions.

Query =>  what kind of eaids signatures are accepted by the registry<br /><br />
Answer =>  Based on the information provided, the Malta Business Registry (MBR) only accepts qualified electronic signatures for electronic submissions, as per the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 910/2014).

Specifically, Article 25(2) of the eIDAS Regulation states that a qualified electronic signature shall have the equivalent legal effect of a handwritten signature. The MBR recognizes qualified electronic signatures in accordance with Article 82 of the Companies Act (Chapter 386 of the Laws of Malta).

A qualified electronic signature is defined in the eIDAS Regulation as:

"An advanced electronic signature that is created by a qualified electronic signature creation device, and which is based on a qualified certificate for electronic signatures issued by a qualified trust service provider."

Therefore, the MBR only accepts qualified electronic signatures that meet these criteria laid out in the eIDAS Regulation. Scanned handwritten signatures or other types of electronic signatures are not accepted.

Answer =>  The process to set up a company in Malta according to the information provided is as follows:

1. Reserve the company name beforehand (suggested but not mandatory).
   - Go to Online Filing (CA) > Name Reservations > Start New Process (Page 22)

2. Start the online company incorporation process:
   - Go to Online Filing (CA) > New Company Registrations > Start New Process (Page 26)
   - Choose the Company Type from the dropdown (Page 27)
   - Select if you have already reserved a company name, and choose it from the dropdown if yes (Page 27)

3. Fill out the Company Details page:
   - Choose Company Type, Suffix, Sector and Area of Activity (Page 27)
   - Input Company Email Address (Page 27)  
   - Input the Registered Address, choose locality first. Provide proof of address if not using Corporate Service Provider's address (Page 27)

Query =>  how are share premium treated in a restructuring of a group
Answer =>  Based on the Companies Act [CAP. 386] of Malta, specifically Article 114A on "Group reconstruction relief", the treatment of share premium in a group restructuring is as follows:

Article 114A(1) states that where a company (the "issuing company") is a qualifying subsidiary of another company (the "holding company"), and it allots shares to the holding company or another qualifying subsidiary in consideration for the transfer of non-cash assets from another group company (the "transferor company"), the issuing company is not required to transfer any amount in excess of the "minimum premium value" to the share premium account.

Article 114A(2) defines the "minimum premium value" as the amount, if any, by which the base value of the consideration for the allotted shares exceeds the nominal value of those shares.

In essence, this provision provides relief for group restructurings by allowing the issuing company to not record the full share premium amount in the share premium account, but only the "minimum premium value" as defined above.

This is an exception to the general rule under Article 114(1), which requires the full share premium amount to be transferred to the share premium account when shares are issued at a premium.

1. Successful preliminary market consultation for the development of a Central Data Repository Solution, aimed at facilitating the process of identification of applicants intending to do business in Malta. This was pledged in the national budget for 2023.

Source: "Another significant landmark in the MBR's activities for 2023 was the preliminary market consultation for the development of Central Data Repository Solution which, as pledged in the national budget for 2023, aims to facilitate the process of identification of applicants who intend to do business in Malta."

2. Attainment of the FHRD (Foundation for Human Resources Development) Quality Mark award after an assessment of the MBR's HR policies and procedures by independent evaluators. The MBR was one of the first organizations in Malta to achieve this award.

Source: "Last, and certainly not the least, these achievements would not have been possible without our hardworking employees who are the beating heart of the MBR's success. 2023 established the foundations, upon which the MBR will continue to develop, improve and strengthen its operations during 2024. [...] When you consider that the MBR was only independently established in 2018, it's understandable that the process to achieve a successful conclusion of this review was no easy one! However, notwithstanding these limitations, the MBR was one of the first organisations in Malta – including among other government entities – to attain this award, and we are very proud of this result."

The information provided does not mention any other specific accolades or achievements for the MBR in 2023.

Query =>  when were the xmas holidays in 2023
Answer =>  Based on the information provided, the Malta Business Registry offices were closed on Tuesday, 26th December 2023 for the Christmas holidays.

This can be seen from the following excerpt:

Source: http://mbr.mt/?p=1446 (Opening Hours during the Festive Season, Date: 2023-12-01)
"The general public is kindly being informed that the Malta Business Registry offices will be closed on Tuesday 26th December, 2023."

However, the online services were still available on that day, as mentioned:

"On the said day, the online services shall continue to be available as usual on the MBR's website: https://register.mbr.mt/"

So in summary, the Christmas holiday closure for the Malta Business Registry offices in 2023 was on Tuesday, 26th December, while online services remained operational.
